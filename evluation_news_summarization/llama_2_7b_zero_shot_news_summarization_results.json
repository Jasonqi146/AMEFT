        "article": "Summary this article. If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming.\n\nMartyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate.\n\nWhen Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points.\n\nAnd they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding\u2019s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures.\n\nMillwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute\u00a0Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal.\n\nLions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy\u00a0Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike.\n\nMartyn Waghorn was one of three players sent off - two for Wigan and one for Millwall in the fiesty clash.\n\nMillwall: Forde (c); Cummings, Nelson, Beevers, Harding; Upson, Abdou, Williams (Bailey 42), Martin (Gueye 68); O\u2019Brien (Woolford 84), Gregory.\n\nSubstitutes not used: Archer (GK); Cowan-Hall, Fuller, Taylor-Fletcher.\n\nScorers: Abdou 75; Gueye 90+3.\n\nBooked: Gregory, Martin, Bailey, Beevers.\n\nSent off: Upson.\n\nWigan Athletic: Carson; Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Pennant (Chow 81), Perch (c), Kvist (Ojo 90+1), Kim Bo-Kyung, McLean; Fortune (Waghorn 53)\n\nSubstitutes not used: Al Habsi (GK); McCann, Barnett, Murphy.\n\nBooked: Bong, Bo-Kyung.\n\nSent off: Waghorn, Pearson.\n\nReferee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire)\n\nIn his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou\u2019s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

        "article": "Summary this article. Dr Mehmet Oz's fellow faculty members at Columbia have written an op-ed lashing out at how his 'unsubstantiated medicine... sullies the reputation' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics.\n\nBut they also leap to the physician's defense in the piece, saying that his on-air 'Ozisms' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university, where he has an unblemished record as a doctor.\n\nThe eight staff wrote the op-ed for\u00a0USA Today\u00a0after 10 doctors urged Columbia to sever all ties with Oz, who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the College of Physicians.\n\nThose doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' on his syndicated talk show - accusations Dr Oz has vehemently fought this week.\n\nScroll down for videos.\n\nUnder fire: Faculty at Columbia University have said some of Dr Mehmet Oz's tactics have 'sullied their reputation' - but also applauded him for the work he had carried out at the Ivy League school.\n\nIn the new op-ed, his fellow faculty also denounced his TV show methods.\n\nThey pointed out that in 2014, the BMJ medical journal said 'that less than half of the recommendations on his show are based on at least somewhat believable evidence'.\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers,' the staff members wrote in the op-ed.\n\n'Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\nThat said, 'the weaknesses in [his] professional balance sheet' should not force him out of his job at Columbia University, where he has been employed since 2001, they wrote.\n\nHe was hired because of his strengths as a doctor and receives top reviews from his peers and patients, and therefore should not be forced to leave the job 'in which he excels', they wrote.\n\nSupport: The eight faculty members, including Drs\u00a0Michael Rosenbaum, left, and Joan Bregstein. right, said they have spent a great deal of their time debunking 'Ozisms' their colleague had shared on air.\n\nInstead, they suggested that his case raises questions of what responsibilities doctors in the media have to their patients.\n\n'What happens when a doctor's job in media-medicine collides with office- or hospital-based medicine? Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.'\n\nRather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.\n\nThe op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nOn Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.\n\n'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.\n\n'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.'\n\nWhile appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",

        "article": "Summary this article. Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.\n\nThe Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.\n\nAt the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it.\n\nPresumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating.\n\nThe party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower.\n\nThe Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS.\n\nWelsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong.\n\nCarwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard.\n\nWhat will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost.\n\nAnother potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation.\n\nBernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors.\n\nIt also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome.\n\nBut Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later.\n\nThe question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny.\n\nPlaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.\n\nThe party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.\n\nHe also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people \"did not see the strengths\" of its arguments.\n\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a \"je ne regrette rien\" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.\n\nShe has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",

        "article": "Summary this article. Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe.\n\nFellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal.\n\nNow Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him.\n\n'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.'\n\nFellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby.\n\nUnited are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.\n\n'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney.\n\n'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in.\n\n'We have been working really hard.\n\n'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.'\n\n'We are confident going to Chelsea.\n\n'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea.\n\nLouis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth.\n\n'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can.\n\n'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue.\n\n'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

        "article": "Summary this article. Ten-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle fell four points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premiership with defeat by St Johnstone.\n\nSteven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee.\n\nLiam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move.\n\nAnd things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel.\n\nSaints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points.\n\nWith game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage.\n\nThey took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box.\n\nOwain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home.\n\nThey should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards.\n\nCraig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points.\n\nCummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.\n\nWith a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term.\n\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.\n\n\"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\n\"It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away.

        "article": "Summary this article. UK manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time in three years, a survey has indicated, adding to fears over the economy's strength.\n\nThe Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output.\n\nIt is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013.\n\nFirms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\nA slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production.\n\nThe index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.\n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\n\n\"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector.\n\nDavid Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality.\n\n\"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.\n\n\"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\"\n\nThe Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",
        "model_output": "The survey also found that firms were cutting back on investment in new machinery and equipment.\n\nThe Bank of England has warned that the UK economy could be heading for a \"material slowdown\" in the second quarter.\n\nThe Bank's latest quarterly inflation report said that the economy was likely to grow by 0.4% in the first three months of the year, down from 0.6% in the final quarter of 2015.\n\nThe report said that the slowdown was due to a \"weaker global economy and the impact of the recent fall in the oil price\".\n\nThe Bank said that the UK economy was likely to grow by 0.4% in the second quarter, but that the outlook was \"highly uncertain\".\n\nThe Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said that the UK economy was \"not immune\" to the global slowdown.\n\nHe said that the Bank was \"monitoring developments closely\" and that it would \"take all necessary steps to support growth and inflation\".\n\nThe Bank's report said that the UK economy

        "article": "Summary this article. Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset.\n\n\"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN.\n\n\"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

The president of the MGM Grand is making a solemn promise to the hundreds of thousands of party-goers already flocking to Las Vegas for Saturday's Fight of the Century.\n\n'They have my guarantee we will not run out of beer this weekend,' says Scott Sibella.\n\nThat is a reference to how Ricky Hatton's trans-Atlantic army of 30,000 fans drank the Strip dry when he fought Floyd Mayweather eight years ago.\n\nWith 10 times that number expected to descend on this oasis in the Nevada desert \u2013 just so they can say 'I was there' on the night Mayweather finally fights Manny Pacquiao \u2013 the MGM food and beverage department are taking no chances.\n\nThe MGM Grand is getting ready to host Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao.\n\nThe hotel resort on the Las Vegas strip will host the biggest boxing contest ever on Saturday night.\n\nAdvertisements for the fight on Saturday night are all over the MGM Grand hotel ahead of the contest.\n\nThe MGM Grand expect 50,000 people each day to pass through for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's fight.\n\n1993 - Year opened.\n\n280ft - height of the four 30-storey towers.\n\n2,500 - slot machines and video poker.\n\n7,000 - Rooms and suites.\n\n9,000 - employees work at the hotel.\n\n16,000 - Garden Arena capacity.\n\n100,000 - people expected for the event.\n\n170,000 - Square feet of gaming.\n\nA convoy of trucks is already delivering the first consignments of half a million bottles of Budweiser, Miller Lite, Corona and Tecate, who are paying more than $5million (\u00a33.3m) to be one of the fight's sponsors.\n\nMany early arrivals are busy now stock-piling cases of their preferred foaming nectar in their rooms at the hotel, which will cost them $1,600 (\u00a31,057) a night come Friday and Saturday.\n\nEven at those prices, they are the lucky ones. The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",

Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' by the sexual assault but freed Josh Sweet after serving just two months on remand.\n\nA burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence.\n\nThe decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal.\n\nJudge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out.\n\nBut Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance.\n\nMadhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep.\n\nIn the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began.\n\nSweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?'\n\nMiss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant.\n\nSweet touched the woman\u2019s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled.\n\nThe police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued.\n\nIn a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe.\n\nShe said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out.\n\nSentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases.\n\nAnd although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'.\n\nJoshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years.\n\nCarolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives.\n\n'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime.\n\nCommunity orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.'\n\nSweet, 20, of Alwold Road, Weoley Castle, Birmingham, who\u00a0admitted burglary and sexual assault, was also ordered to do 150 hours\u00a0unpaid work and register as a sex offender for five years.\n\nThe judge also made a restraining order banning the defendant from going to the victim's road or having any contact with her.\n\nMohammed Hafeez, defending, said Sweet was a young man with many difficulties  and had been the victim of serious offences himself which had had a 'significant' effect on his mental health.\n\nHe said the death of a daughter had caused him to drink to excess and that he had little recollection of what he had done.",

        "article": "Summary this article. The town of Reading may have been swept up in FA Cup euphoria, but Steve Clarke has instructed his players to approach this weekend's semi-final like any other day at work.\n\nIt has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal.\n\nReading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground.\n\nReading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final.\n\nClarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective.\n\n'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said.\n\n'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal.\n\n'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch.\n\nThe Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley.\n\n'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run.\n\n'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.'\n\nClarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith.\n\nOne bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins.\n\nIt has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.\n\n'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said.

The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power.\n\nNick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed.\n\nBut behind the scenes,\u00a0senior\u00a0party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the\u00a0thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nNick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire.\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nInstead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance.\n\nA party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government.\n\nThe senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off.\n\nAssessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is.\n\n'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.'\n\nAsked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.'\n\nPressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me.\n\n'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft.

With the new Avengers: Age of Ultron movie released this week,  James Haskell showed off his inner Iron Man in a serious-looking Instagram post.\n\nThe highly-anticipated movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre on Tuesday evening with fans queuing up to see the A-list cast which includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAnd the London Wasps captain joined in on the hype as he posted the photo dressed as\u00a0Downey Jr.'s character Iron Man.\n\nEngland flanker James Haskell dressed in Iron Man costume and posted it on his Instagram page.\n\nThe London Wasps captain (middle) returned to the club where he started his career for the 2012 season.\n\nHaskell posted the image on Thursday along with the message: 'Avengers movie is out so thought i would release the inner Iron Man. @UnderArmourUK #TransformYourself #IWILL #AvengersAgeOfUltron.'\n\nThe flanker returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais,\u00a0Ricoh Black Rams\u00a0and\u00a0Highlanders in New Zealand.\n\nWindsor-born\u00a0Haskell first joined Wasps in 2002, playing eight seasons for the club and winning his first England cap five years later.\n\nBut in 2009,  he moved to Stade Francais in France and spent two seasons in the French capital before he made the move to Tokyo with the\u00a0Ricoh Black Rams following the unsuccessful 2011 World Cup.\n\nFour months in Japan with the Rams and Haskell was on the move again when he switched to New Zealand to join the Highlanders. However, he made only 12 appearances and returned to England in 2012.\n\nSince returning to Wasps, Haskell has surpassed the 100 appearances mark for the club and has become a big part of the England squad with 57 caps to-date.\n\nHaskell has played his rugby in France, Japan and New Zealand after leaving the Wasps in 2009.\n\nSince his return to England, Haskell has enjoyed his rugby and surpassed the 100 appearance mark for Wasps.",

        "article": "Summary this article. It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.\n\nHarper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.\n\nLee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.\n\nShe doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.\n\nBut her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.\n\nSitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.\n\n\"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

Counting of Kenyan election results has slowed down because of problems with the electronic systems.\n\nReturning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital.\n\nElection officials have urged patience.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.\n\nHe is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

        "article": "Summary this article. Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes.\n\nThe popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell.\n\nBut for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters.\n\nThe child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",

        "article": "Summary this article. The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised.\n\nThey call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check.\n\nThere is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light.\n\nPeople in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nResidents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. \u00a0Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial.\n\nThe officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",

        "article": "Summary this article. (CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",

Holidaying with the lair of a tiger as your closest neighbour might not sound like the cleverest idea in the world but it is certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that won't be forgotten.\n\nFor \u00a33,500, tourists are being invited to book a trip to Russia and sleep in the natural habitat of the Siberian tiger, one of the world's most endangered animals.\n\nBespoke tour operators Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which also gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat.\n\nA safari stay in Russia offers tourists the chance to spot, and sleep near, one of the world's most endangered animals- the Siberian tiger.\n\nBespoke holiday providers Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat.\n\nThe trip to Durminskoye Reserve in Khabarovsk lasts seven days in total with guests spending time in the wild environs inhabited by the last remaining Siberian tigers, and setting camera traps with the experts in the hope of catching an insight into the lives of these endangered predators.\n\nThey will walk in the footsteps of the world\u2019s biggest cats and spend time with Alexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist who has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger.\n\nThe facilities are described as 'basic' and guests are provided with a translator throughout the stay.\n\nThe daily activity is to explore the Reserve in the hope of picking up tracks of the Siberian tigers that reside in this area.\n\nThis shot was captured at night as a Siberian Tiger walked down a narrow road in the\u00a0Durminskoye Reserve, where guests can stay.\n\nHuntsman\u2019s hut in the forest \u2013 sustainable hunting is still allowed in the forest and the hut is also used as a base of operations.\n\nThe safari does not actively track them as this risks guests coming face-to-face with the animals themselves, which is why still and video cameras are set up.\n\nThe images and footage from these actively assist Alexander and his team as they work to save the tigers of the region from extinction.\n\nManaging Director of Natural World Safaris and expert in wildlife encounters, Will Bolsover, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The trip is one of the rarest wildlife travel opportunities remaining today.\n\nAlexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist, has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger.\n\nInside Balatov's hut, dedicated to the natural world as you might expect with a range of feathers and animal bones.\n\n'Spending time with Alexander Batalov in the home of the some of the last remaining Siberian tigers in Russia\u2019s Far East, setting camera traps, tracking tiger footprints and collecting vital conservation data is a superb opportunity.\u2019\n\nIt is estimated the current wild population of Siberian tigers under 400, making the species officially endangered.\n\nSiberian tigers were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean peninsula but by the 1940s, hunting had driven the species, also known as the Amur tiger, to the brink of extinction with no more than 40 individuals remaining in the wild.\n\nWhile the population has now stabilised somewhat, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as the tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies and a limited density of prey means they have to search over large areas to find food.\n\nGuests will stay in a wooden cabin on the Natural World Safari trip to see the Siberian tiger.\n\n'Guests will be staying directly in the heart of the tigers' habitat, but with the cats being extremely elusive, it obviously isn\u2019t guaranteed that they will even come face to face with a tiger at all,'\u00a0Bolsover said.\n\n'While they are out setting camera traps and observing scent trails, footprints, scratch marks on trees, they will be exactly where the tigers tread.\n\n'While they are out in the forest or in the camp, a tiger could be 20m away, 200m away, or as far as two miles away- it\u2019s difficult to put a numerical value on it.'\n\nClick here for more information regarding the safari trip.",

        "article": "Summary this article. It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.\n\nHarper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.\n\nLee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.\n\nShe doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.\n\nBut her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.\n\nSitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.\n\n\"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

        "article": "Summary this article. Counting of Kenyan election results has slowed down because of problems with the electronic systems.\n\nReturning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital.\n\nElection officials have urged patience.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.\n\nHe is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

        "article": "Summary this article. Ten-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle fell four points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premiership with defeat by St Johnstone.\n\nSteven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee.\n\nLiam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move.\n\nAnd things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel.\n\nSaints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points.\n\nWith game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage.\n\nThey took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box.\n\nOwain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home.\n\nThey should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards.\n\nCraig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points.\n\nCummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.\n\nWith a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term.\n\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.\n\n\"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\n\"It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away.

        "article": "Summary this article. Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title.\n\nMendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year.\n\nBut it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight.\n\nOpponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center.\n\nLamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

        "article": "Summary this article. Counting of Kenyan election results has slowed down because of problems with the electronic systems.\n\nReturning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital.\n\nElection officials have urged patience.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.\n\nHe is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

A man has admitted killing his wife of 25 years while she slept.\n\nAsghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found.\n\nHe admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year.\n\nBuksh will be sentenced on 27 June.\n\nThe High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times.\n\nPathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept.\n\nFollowing the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\"\n\nThe court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time.\n\nProsecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof.\n\n\"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\"\n\nMr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year.\n\nHe said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan.\n\nThe court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return.\n\nHe also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping.\n\nHe was prescribed medication for stress.\n\nDefence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine.\n\n\"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.\n\n\"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\"\n\nJudge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",

However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.",

        "article": "Summary this article. Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset.\n\n\"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN.\n\n\"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

Counting of Kenyan election results has slowed down because of problems with the electronic systems.\n\nReturning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital.\n\nElection officials have urged patience.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.\n\nHe is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

Western Sahara has welcomed Morocco's readmission to the African Union, 32 years after members refused to withdraw support for the territory's independence.\n\nIt was a \"good opportunity\" and \"a chance to work together,\" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC.\n\nMorocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory.\n\nHowever some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony.\n\nAfrica Live: More on this and other stories\n\nFind out more about Western Sahara\n\nA referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote.\n\nThousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years.\n\nIt is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised.\n\nSome AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU.\n\nSidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put \"in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara\".\n\nMr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation.\n\nIn his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body.\n\nNo. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission.\n\nZimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold.\n\nThere is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it.\n\nMorocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members.\n\nMorocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body.\n\nKing Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid.\n\nNo. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa.\n\nThis is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.\n\nMoroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975.\n\nKitesurfing in a danger zone\n\nInside world's most remote film festival\n\nProfile: African Union",

        "article": "Summary this article. A report about a woman who said she had repeated plastic surgery after her husband divorced her because she had a \"fat face\" has sparked outrage among China's online community.\n\nThough the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, \"divorced because of fat face\" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo.\n\nState media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week.\n\nLiaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\".\n\nShe said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape.\n\nDuring the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure.\n\nThe woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages.\n\nShe alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\".\n\nThe hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused.\n\nAfter mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report.\n\nOn Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman.\n\nOne top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

        "article": "Summary this article. Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title.\n\nMendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year.\n\nBut it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight.\n\nOpponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center.\n\nLamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

A 6,000-year-old \"eco-home\" has been discovered close to Stonehenge, archaeologists have revealed.\n\nThe shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed.\n\nArchaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\"\n\nThe finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge.\n\nArchaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site.\n\nDiscoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug.\n\nMr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants.\n\nThe tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow\".\n\n\"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said.\n\nThe wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with \"exotic\" stones from outside the area.\n\n\"There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,\" explained Mr Jacques.\n\n\"It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them.\"\n\nMr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made.\n\n\"It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,\" he said.\n\n\"It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood.\n\n\"This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like.\"\n\nAndy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: \"I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape.\n\n\"It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.\"",

Formula 1 driver Maria de Villota has lost her right eye following a test track crash.\n\nShe was hurt when the MR-01 race car she was driving hit a support truck at Duxford airfield in Cambridgeshire on Tuesday.\n\nIt was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team.\n\nInspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday.\n\nMarussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge \"embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident\".\n\nIt said: \"The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning.\n\n\"Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.\"\n\nJohn Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: \"Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday.\n\n\"We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams.\n\n\"However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye.\n\n\"Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them.\"\n\nDe Villota sustained her injuries after her car \"suddenly accelerated\" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses.\n\nBBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: \"The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it.\n\n\"She didn't move for about 15 minutes.\"\n\nHe said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash.\n\nMr Booth said: \"With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.\"\n\nMessages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button.\n\nFormula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column\n\n: \"I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened.\n\n\"It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers.\n\n\"She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1. So this is a very sad situation.\n\n\"Thankfully, she is not in a life-threatening situation so we have to look at the positive side. We will see Maria again.\"\n\nLewis Hamilton tweeted: \"Just heard about Maria's terrible accident at Duxford. I hope she pulls through. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.\"\n\nThe McLaren driver said later: \"I don't understand how it happened or how it was able to happen.\"",

        "article": "Summary this article. Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the Amazon.\n\nThey say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - \u00a0and that the  bacteria they found could be\u00a0potentially beneficial to modern society.\n\nResearchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami.\n\nThere are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains.\n\nThe Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America.\n\nThere are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains.\n\nThe Yanomami are hunter-gatherers.\n\nThey gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava.\n\nThey hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir.\n\nThe group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock.\n\nThe researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group.\n\n'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said.\n\n'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight.\n\nIn the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami.\n\nThis information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics.\n\n'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote.\n\nMany Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people.\n\nOne such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

They work dark sunglasses, kept quiet and went unrecognized. It took security camera footage to prove they were ever there.\n\nOnce in Iowa, Clinton's campaign vetted and planted fans of the Democrat in a coffee shop it knew she would make an unannounced stop at and hold what appeared at the time to be an impromptu round table discussion.\n\nThe back-to-back incidents were widely panned as further proof that Clinton is out-of-touch.\n\nClinton skipped the long ride home and returned via commercial aircraft. She sat in the coach section, though, and was photographed dragging around her own luggage.\n\nWEEKEND OUTING: Hillary wasn't the only one spending time with her husband. Huma Abedin, her closest aide, was with her husband Anthony Weiner, notorious for sabotaging his own political career by sending explicit pictures. The couple ignored the chance to go to Chipotle, two doors down from this New York taco restaurant.\n\nBRUSH-UP: Meanwhile, the two rest of the enoturage for the vans she's been riding around in got some TLC at a local car wash.\n\nCAR WASH: The vehicles were also washed by hand.\u00a0Clinton skipped the long ride home last week from Iowa and returned via commercial aircraft. She'll make the short drive from New York to New Hampshire in her motorcade today, however.\n\nCLOSELY-GUARDED: The Hillary motorcade includes these - now sparkling - Chevy Suburbans.",

        "article": "Summary this article. Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad.\n\nThe 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'.\n\nRedknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium.\n\nHarry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club.\n\nRedknapp was speaking at the announcement of a\u00a0Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match.\n\nThe well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances.\n\n'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said.\n\n'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do.\n\n'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me.\n\n'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do.\n\nRedknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February.\n\nRedknapp left the Loftus Road outfit\u00a0citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago.\n\nThe 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time.\n\n'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested.\n\n'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.'\n\nWhile it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches.\n\nHe said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level.\n\nRedknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club.\n\nThe Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining.\n\n'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch.\n\n'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.'\n\nRedknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year.\n\nHe said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause.\n\n'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'\n\nRedknapp \u00a0lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer.\n\nPeople are being urged to search Men United and do something great with their mates via prostatecanceruk.org/menunited. Tickets for the Men United XI match are priced at \u00a310 adults and \u00a35 concessions, and are available from www.lofcdirect.co.uk.",

Holidaying with the lair of a tiger as your closest neighbour might not sound like the cleverest idea in the world but it is certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that won't be forgotten.\n\nFor \u00a33,500, tourists are being invited to book a trip to Russia and sleep in the natural habitat of the Siberian tiger, one of the world's most endangered animals.\n\nBespoke tour operators Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which also gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat.\n\nA safari stay in Russia offers tourists the chance to spot, and sleep near, one of the world's most endangered animals- the Siberian tiger.\n\nBespoke holiday providers Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat.\n\nThe trip to Durminskoye Reserve in Khabarovsk lasts seven days in total with guests spending time in the wild environs inhabited by the last remaining Siberian tigers, and setting camera traps with the experts in the hope of catching an insight into the lives of these endangered predators.\n\nThey will walk in the footsteps of the world\u2019s biggest cats and spend time with Alexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist who has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger.\n\nThe facilities are described as 'basic' and guests are provided with a translator throughout the stay.\n\nThe daily activity is to explore the Reserve in the hope of picking up tracks of the Siberian tigers that reside in this area.\n\nThis shot was captured at night as a Siberian Tiger walked down a narrow road in the\u00a0Durminskoye Reserve, where guests can stay.\n\nHuntsman\u2019s hut in the forest \u2013 sustainable hunting is still allowed in the forest and the hut is also used as a base of operations.\n\nThe safari does not actively track them as this risks guests coming face-to-face with the animals themselves, which is why still and video cameras are set up.\n\nThe images and footage from these actively assist Alexander and his team as they work to save the tigers of the region from extinction.\n\nManaging Director of Natural World Safaris and expert in wildlife encounters, Will Bolsover, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The trip is one of the rarest wildlife travel opportunities remaining today.\n\nAlexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist, has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger.\n\nInside Balatov's hut, dedicated to the natural world as you might expect with a range of feathers and animal bones.\n\n'Spending time with Alexander Batalov in the home of the some of the last remaining Siberian tigers in Russia\u2019s Far East, setting camera traps, tracking tiger footprints and collecting vital conservation data is a superb opportunity.\u2019\n\nIt is estimated the current wild population of Siberian tigers under 400, making the species officially endangered.\n\nSiberian tigers were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean peninsula but by the 1940s, hunting had driven the species, also known as the Amur tiger, to the brink of extinction with no more than 40 individuals remaining in the wild.\n\nWhile the population has now stabilised somewhat, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as the tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies and a limited density of prey means they have to search over large areas to find food.\n\nGuests will stay in a wooden cabin on the Natural World Safari trip to see the Siberian tiger.\n\n'Guests will be staying directly in the heart of the tigers' habitat, but with the cats being extremely elusive, it obviously isn\u2019t guaranteed that they will even come face to face with a tiger at all,'\u00a0Bolsover said.\n\n'While they are out setting camera traps and observing scent trails, footprints, scratch marks on trees, they will be exactly where the tigers tread.\n\n'While they are out in the forest or in the camp, a tiger could be 20m away, 200m away, or as far as two miles away- it\u2019s difficult to put a numerical value on it.'\n\nClick here for more information regarding the safari trip.",

        "article": "Summary this article. It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.\n\nHarper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.\n\nLee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.\n\nShe doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.\n\nBut her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.\n\nSitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.\n\n\"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

        "article": "Summary this article. English cricket\u2019s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director.\n\nDownton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body\u2019s management board ahead of their spring meeting today.\n\nThe decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England\u2019s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just \u2018too accident prone\u2019.\n\nPaul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board.\n\nDownton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup.\n\nIt was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him \u2018the outstanding coach of his generation\u2019. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019.\n\nMARCH 2014.\n\nEngland suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18.\n\nAPRIL 2014.\n\nDownton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach.\n\nMAY 2014.\n\nDownton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared \u2018disinterested\u2019 and \u2018distracted\u2019 during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney.\n\nJUNE 2014.\n\nEngland lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 \u2014 in a one-off Test match.\n\nJULY-AUG 2014.\n\nEngland lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history.\n\nDECEMBER 2014.\n\nCook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats.\n\nFEBRUARY-MARCH 2015.\n\nEngland endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory.\n\nAPRIL 2015.\n\nDownton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of \u2018director of England Cricket\u2019 ahead of the Ashes series.",

A 6,000-year-old \"eco-home\" has been discovered close to Stonehenge, archaeologists have revealed.\n\nThe shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed.\n\nArchaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\"\n\nThe finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge.\n\nArchaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site.\n\nDiscoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug.\n\nMr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants.\n\nThe tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow\".\n\n\"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said.\n\nThe wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with \"exotic\" stones from outside the area.\n\n\"There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,\" explained Mr Jacques.\n\n\"It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them.\"\n\nMr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made.\n\n\"It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,\" he said.\n\n\"It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood.\n\n\"This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like.\"\n\nAndy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: \"I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape.\n\n\"It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.\"",

        "article": "Summary this article. The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.\n\nBHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\"\n\nAmong the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg.\n\nRussia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov.\n\nPanellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde.\n\nUnder the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.\n\nCampaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\"\n\nRobert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.\n\n\"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\".",

        "article": "Summary this article. It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.\n\nHarper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.\n\nLee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.\n\nShe doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.\n\nBut her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.\n\nSitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.\n\n\"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",
