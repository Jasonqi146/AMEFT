        "article": "\"It's all about taking an opportunity in a crisis,\" says the outgoing Conservative leader of Melton Borough Council.\n\nByron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy.\n\nThe building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free.\n\nNow the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre.\n\nIt was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town.\n\nA supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing.\n\nBut that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide.\n\nMr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance.\n\nLeicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped.\n\nAt the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government.\n\nIt's the grant cut which is causing them grief.\n\nWhat's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling.\n\nIf we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be \u00a31,686 by 2019/20.\n\nNottinghamshire is mid-table at \u00a31,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with \u00a31,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at \u00a31,354.\n\n\"The funding system is chaotic,\" says Byron Rhodes.\n\n\"It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,\" he says with a glint in his eye.\n\nCould he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there?\n\n\"If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have \u00a350m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have \u00a3100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money.\"\n\nLeicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about \u00a3300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs.\n\nThink back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled.\n\nLast month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years.\n\nThe money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got \u00a36.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure.\n\nBut it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a \u00a319m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks.\n\nLabour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, got nothing.\n\nThe leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a \"fair funding for Derby\" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair and political and the cuts they're having to impose on leisure services and culture are devastating.\n\n\"Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability to function is under threat,\" said Mr Banwait.\n\nBack in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council in Derby.\n\n\"Derby probably have some greater needs,\" he says.\n\nBut once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis.\n\nLeicestershire's finance team are working on a submission to put to the government with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated.\n\n\"We're going to do it. We're going to work up a system which is fairer.\"\n\nHe has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities.\n\nAnd with a hand out to Derby, he says: \"If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them.\"\n\nIt's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go.\n\nCouncils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead.\n\nHow they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.",
        "summary": "Four years after finally building a modern Council Headquarters in Melton, the council is facing financial difficulties due to unfair funding allocation. With the threat of being forced to end their services, officials are determined to develop and present a fair funding plan to the authorities. "

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5.\n\nRoyal winner: Camilla\u2019s honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile'\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey.\n\n\u00a35.10 for 227g, Waitrose.\n\nPROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.\n\nVERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles\u2019s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.\n\n\u00a314.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards. Now I\u2019ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka.\n\n\u00a329.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting version and Britain\u2019s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "summary": "The Duchess of Cornwall Honey is a little bit more expensive than most honey products, which is why a test was conducted to compare and justify its price. As promised, the Duchess of Cornwall Honey has higher quality than most of the cheaper brands. In addition, all proceeds will go to charity. "

Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "summary": "The gourmet honey industry is small but growing, and it seems there is room for new producers. The Duchess of Cornwall has produced a small, limited batch to raise funds for charity, and gets raving reviews even when compared to other gourmet specialty honeys. "

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",
        "summary": "Rich and eccentric Aubrey de Grey believes that aging can be reversed or even stopped by technologies and discoveries that are currently being developed. Despite critics and many experts dismissing his theory, he has gained some support from the ultra-rich in his quest to keep people alive forever."

With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "summary": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy.

Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",
        "summary": "After reviewing previous trials, analyzing evidence, and talking to key witnesses and medical experts involved in a Nueces County murder trial in 2010, suspect Hannah Overton's charges were dropped. Although Hannah was accused of poisoning her adopted son, there was not enough evidence to prove it-- which led to the trial being dismissed."

While built at road level it is 300ft from the top of the hill.\n\nSet up by Rover under the instruction of the Air Ministry, Drakelow was one of 26 'underground' factories established to allow production lines to continue if the country came under fire.\n\nWith more than 700 people working at the site at a time it was one of the largest underground factories during the war.\n\nMrs Cartwright was sent to work there in 1943 after being called up at the age of 20. She had wanted to join the Civil Service beforehand.\n\nA stretch of offices in the underground factory. Their windows were high up so that staff would not be distracted by co-workers walking by.\n\nThe kitchen where staff would have eaten during one of the long, underground shifts. Mrs Cartwright had no previous experience when she was called up, but said she 'just got on with the job'\n\nMrs Cartwright said while the tunnels were built to protect production lines from bombing, by the time she began working at Drakelow the worst of the raids had already hit the country. Right, a newspaper cutting from 1941 detailing the deaths of three men killed when one of the tunnels collapsed during 'excavating operations'\n\n'I'd had no experience at the time, someone, I think my sister-in-law, just gave me a book which told me how to do it and I just got on with it,' Mrs Cartwright told MailOnline.\n\n'The metal could come in and it would be one of the men who would drill it into shavings. I'd dissolve it in acid and then put something on it that would allow me to analyse it so I could find how much nickle, chrome etc was in each part.'\n\nThe only woman in the laboratory, Mrs Cartwright had wanted to serve in the army before being called up.\n\n'In a way it was luck of the draw an din a way it wasn't. I wanted to go into the forces but parents in those days told you what to do and mine said: \"no, you'll go into industry.\"'\n\nEarning \u00a33 a week, she was also tasked with taking photographs of the metal for developing in a dark room next door.\n\nWhile the factory's design was so carried out to avoid raids, the worst of the bombing across Britain had already occurred by the time Mrs Cartwright took up work, she said.\n\n'They started building the tunnels in 1941, quite late in the war. Around that time we were being badly bombed but never when I was there.'\n\nThe site was restored in the 1980s by the Ministry of Defence which installed two KW generators.\n\nTunnel 4, one of the main passageways used during the Second World War to shuttle workers to their stations.\n\nAfter the war ended, Mrs Cartwright trained as a teacher and spent years teaching P.E. in Worcester.\n\nShe met her late husband, Cecil Cartwright, after the war had ended and the pair married in 1953.\n\nRevisiting the Drakelow Tunnels with one of her sons, John, the great-grandmother said it was 'strange' to see it so quiet.\n\nIn 1936, the Air Ministry approached the car manufacturer Rover, asking them to help with wartime production.\n\nBy 1939, all motoring production had ceased and the company had begun working solely on aircraft parts and engines.\n\nBut when its Coventry factory was blitzed, bosses cited the need for a more secure setting to allow production to continue.\n\nShadow Factories were then created. Built underground, safe from the shelling of Hitler's army, workers were free to work on engines for military aircraft and tanks.\n\nA canteen that was reused  during the Cold War when Drakelow Factory became a Government bunker.\n\nThe Drakelow site was one of the largest, spanning more than three miles. Built into\u00a0Kingsford Country Park, the factory is 300ft from the top of the hill but is in fact at road level.\n\nIt was used to produce aircraft engines specifically for four models of Bristol aircraft; the Pegasus, Hercules, Centaur and Mercury.\n\nWhen demand wavered at the end of the war some staff were kept on to continue working on tanks.\n\nProduction of the Meteor Tank Engine continued until 1952 when parts became surplus to requirements. All production stopped indefinitely thee years later when the site was handed over to the Ministry of Works.\n\nIn 1961 the Government converted half of the tunnels to become a nuclear-safe bunker known as Regional Seat of Government.\n\nBy the 1980s it had been modernised again with new blast doors fitted to meet updated requirements.\n\nIt was decommissioned and sold to a private company in the early 1990s and remains in their ownership.\n\n'All my memories are of a bustling hive of activity. I did enjoy my time there, it was certainly an experience. I just got on with it.'\n\nThe Drakelow Tunnels or Shadow Factory was one of 26 of the same kind across the UK, built into the ground or landscape.\n\nDuring the war it was used to produce engine parts for four Bristol aircraft - Hercules, Pegasus, Centaur and Mercury.\n\nFor a short while afterward the war production continued but to create parts for army tanks.\n\nThe site is owned by a private Swiss company, though historians are eager to turn it into a permanent museum.",

The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",

Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena.

After the Conservatives threw the kitchen sink at the subsequent by-election, Mr Reckless held it with a majority of 2,920.\n\nIn September, Mr Reckless followed Douglas Carswell to become the second Conservative to defect to Ukip.\n\nThe turncoat MP was unrepentant about his defection, insisting the Tories had broken promises on immigration and reducing the deficit.\n\nSenior Conservatives reacted with fury. \u00a0Party chairman Grant Shapps used the opening speech of the Tory conference to mount a sustained attack on Mr Reckless, declaring: \u2018He lied and lied and lied again.\u2019\n\nMr Cameron has admitted that the pressures of wooing voters means their regular date nights will have to be put on hold.\n\nHe told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think that will probably be a bit testing. I think there won't be much time for some of those things.\n\n'Samantha's going to be on the campaign trail with me.

        "article": "The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised.\n\nThey call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check.\n\nThere is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light.\n\nPeople in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nResidents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. \u00a0Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial.\n\nThe officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said.

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",
        "summary": "The Liberal Democrats are slated to lose roughly 20 MPs in the upcoming election. Support for the party waned after a strong showing in the 2010 elections. Despite the losses, the party leader Nick Clegg believes that the Liberal Democrats will still be in power.   "

        "summary": "A significant discovery has been made in a forest in Northern Ireland.  Items discovered reportedly included improvised armor-piercing rockets and two anti-personnel mines.  Considering the location where the items were found, it is believed they belonged to loyalist paramilitaries.  Also discovered were parts used for the construction of explosive devices."

He denies the charge.\n\nHis closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nWith provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.\n\nHowever, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.\n\nSome businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta\n\nRaila Odinga\n\nProfile: Uhuru Kenyatta\n\nProfile: Raila Odinga\n\nSome electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.\n\nAt about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.\n\nIts website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.\n\nOur correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.\n\nMr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.\n\nLate on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.\n\nMr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.\n\n\"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nBut the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.\n\nAs there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that \"choices have consequences\".\n\nThe winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.\n\nIf there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.\n\nKenya elections: Maps and graphics",

        "article": "Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' by the sexual assault but freed Josh Sweet after serving just two months on remand.\n\nA burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence.\n\nThe decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal.\n\nJudge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out.\n\nBut Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance.\n\nMadhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep.\n\nIn the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began.\n\nSweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?'\n\nMiss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant.\n\nSweet touched the woman\u2019s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled.\n\nThe police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued.\n\nIn a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe.\n\nShe said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out.\n\nSentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases.\n\nAnd although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'.\n\nJoshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years.\n\nCarolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives.\n\n'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime.\n\nCommunity orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.'\n\nSweet, 20, of Alwold Road, Weoley Castle, Birmingham, who\u00a0admitted burglary and sexual assault, was also ordered to do 150 hours\u00a0unpaid work and register as a sex offender for five years.\n\nThe judge also made a restraining order banning the defendant from going to the victim's road or having any contact with her.\n\nMohammed Hafeez, defending, said Sweet was a young man with many difficulties  and had been the victim of serious offences himself which had had a 'significant' effect on his mental health.\n\nHe said the death of a daughter had caused him to drink to excess and that he had little recollection of what he had done.",
        "summary": "Joshua Sweet was given a three-year community order after touching a young teacher's bottom and upper thigh against her will. The decision was slammed by victim advocacy groups who demanded justice, stating the 150-hour unpaid work order and being required to register as a sex offender wasn't punishment enough.  "

A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000.\n\nSo what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies.\n\nThe rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment.\n\nFanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none.\n\n'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol.

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter\u00a0Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past.\n\nAfter questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview.\n\nChannel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life.\n\nIn the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.\n\nThe American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal.\n\nSeemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.\n\nAt that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].'\n\nThe horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat.\n\nBut Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives.\n\nJustin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nAnd Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.\n\nHere are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:.\n\nThe model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given.\n\nNAOMI CAMPBELL.\n\nIn April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way.\n\nThe reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.\n\nNaomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.'\n\nThe interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.\n\nIn court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.\n\nRobert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart.\n\nROBERT PATTINSON.\n\nWhen Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest.\n\nRyan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart.\n\nRyan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.\n\nRob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off.\n\nAs Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension.\n\nJustin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER.\n\nIn 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning.\n\nThe host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nJustin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.'\n\nHe then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.\n\nThe presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'\n\nThe radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.",
        "summary": "Robert Downey Junior is the latest in a long line of celebrities who have walked out on interviews. Interviewers often discuss sensitive topics such as relationships, children, and drug use, but these sensitive topics can prove to be too personal and cause the interviewee to walk out. "

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter\u00a0Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past.\n\nAfter questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview.\n\nChannel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life.\n\nIn the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.\n\nThe American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal.\n\nSeemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.\n\nAt that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].'\n\nThe horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat.\n\nBut Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives.\n\nJustin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nAnd Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.\n\nHere are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:.\n\nThe model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given.\n\nNAOMI CAMPBELL.\n\nIn April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way.\n\nThe reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.\n\nNaomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.'\n\nThe interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.\n\nIn court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.\n\nRobert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart.\n\nROBERT PATTINSON.\n\nWhen Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest.\n\nRyan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart.\n\nRyan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.\n\nRob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off.\n\nAs Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension.\n\nJustin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER.\n\nIn 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning.\n\nThe host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nJustin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.'\n\nHe then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.\n\nThe presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'\n\nThe radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.",
        "summary": "Robert Downey Junior walked out of an interview with Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy after he was questioned about his past drug use. Downey, who is in London promoting his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron, appeared horrified and aggravated when Guru-Murthy attempted to take the interview down a personal route- so he left."

        "article": "Arcade Fire brought a party atmosphere to Glastonbury on Friday, hours after an electric storm stopped the festival.\n\nAided by dancers, confetti cannons and a man in a mirrored suit, the Canadian band revived revellers' spirits with a series of arms-aloft anthems.\n\n\"In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,\" said frontman Win Butler.\n\nEarlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground.\n\nDance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman.\n\n\"We're quite upset,\" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, \"but we had a great time anyway\".\n\nMetallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended.\n\n\"It was kind of frightening,\" he said.\n\n\"When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'.\n\n\"But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe.

A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse.\n\nObject of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures.\n\nA statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.\n\nThe defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised.\n\nIn the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi.\n\nStanding in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance.\n\nThe protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country.\n\nFounding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted.\n\nIn Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports.\n\nThe statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest.\n\nIn the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg.\n\nAnother statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square.\n\nSecurity guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town.\n\nSeveral people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues.\n\nThe opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has come out in support of its members who have claimed responsibility for these acts of vandalism.\n\nIt comes days after white solidarity groups held protests over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town after it was daubed with excrement.\n\nMembers of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture be removed after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression.\n\nThe defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue.\n\nThe monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved.\n\nThe government backed the move, with Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, saying they are working to see if the country can take an 'official position' on statues and other colonial symbols.\n\n'It marks a significant... shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way', he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues.\n\nBut the decision to move the monument of Rhodes \u2013 a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid \u2013 has sparked protests in itself.\n\nThe youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to 'demand protection' for their heritage.\n\nThe same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March.\n\nThe university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument.\n\nPolitician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents.\n\nBorn in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him.\n\nHe believed England was the 'master race', and wanted to draw a 'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa.\n\nWhile his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work.\n\nWhile they are not recognised as supporters of Rhodes, statues of their heroes have been attacked during the university protests.\n\nA monument of former president Paul Kruger was splattered with paint, and Afrikaner men, some of them in quasi-military outfits, demonstrated next to it on Wednesday.\n\n'The Afrikaner is -- from a historical perspective -- increasingly being portrayed as criminals and land thieves,' solidary group Afriforum said in a statement.\n\n'If the heritage of the Afrikaner is not important to Government, our youth members will preserve our own heritage.'\n\nIt has not been decided where the statue of Rhodes will end up, although it will likely be held in a museum.\n\nBut as tension grow on campuses about the statues of historical South African figures, Jonathan Jansen \u2013 the first black vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State \u2013 denied that there was a race war coming.\n\nHe wrote in South African newspaper The Times on Thursday: 'The reason is simple: the overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, believe in a middle path somewhere between reconciliation and social justice.'\n\nCecil Rhodes, pictured on the right, in 1896 in Rhodesia with an unknown companion and a black manservant.\n\nPeople look the defaced statue of former South African president Paul Kruger in Church Square, Pretoria.",

        "article": "David Cameron became \"distracted\" after the 2011 intervention in Libya, US President Barack Obama has said.\n\nSpeaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now \"a mess\".\n\nThe article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its \"fair share\" and spend 2% of GDP on defence.\n\nIn response, Number 10 said there were \"many difficult challenges\" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions.\n\nDowning Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year.\n\nIn response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been \"as close a partner as the president has had\" adding that \"we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives\".\n\nBBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article.\n\n\"It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,\" he added.\n\nThe toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.\n\nThe intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on \"what went wrong\", saying: \"There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up.\"\n\nMr Cameron, he said, became \"distracted by a range of other things\". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight.\n\nThe former French president, he said, \"wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure\" for the intervention.\n\nPresident Obama said the intervention \"averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict\". But he added: \"And despite all that, Libya is a mess.\"\n\nHe also criticised what he called \"free riders\" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: \"But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.\"\n\nDespite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.\n\nIn January, Mr Cameron told MPs the \"Libyan people were given the opportunity\" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter of \"huge regret\" they had not taken it.\n\nHe stressed that - unlike in Iraq - the post-conflict planning was locally driven.\n\n\"Gaddafi was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats,\" he said. \"An international coalition came together to protect those people and to help the Libyan people, who then got rid of Gaddafi.\n\n\"And they had an opportunity to build what they said they wanted.\"\n\nResponding to President Obama's interview, Downing Street said \"coming to the aid of innocent civilians who were being tortured and killed by their leader was the right thing to do\".\n\nThe government has tried to support stability in Libya and is \"working hard to support the UN-led process to establish a stable and inclusive government that will allow them to build a peaceful future\", a spokesman said.\n\n\"But ultimately a positive outcome for Libya is not just up to the international community - this process needs to be led by the Libyan people,\" he added.\n\nThe US National Security Council spokesman added: \"With respect to Libya, the president has long said that all of us - including the United States - could have done more in the aftermath of the Libyan intervention.\"\n\nHe said the UK had \"stepped up on a range of issues\" including meeting the 2% commitment and pressing other Nato members to do the same.\n\nFormer Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said it was \"a bit rich\" for the US president to single out the UK and France, as they had carried out more air operations in the Libya campaign than any other country.\n\n15 February 2011 - Protests against Colonel Gaddafi's regime erupt in Libya\n\n20 February - Anti-Gaddafi rebels seize control of Libya's second city Benghazi\n\n21 February - David Cameron, on a tour of the Middle East, condemns violence by the Gaddafi regime. Over the next few days he faces criticism over the government's handling of the evacuation of Britons from Libya\n\n28 February: Mr Cameron asks the Ministry of Defence to \"work with our allies on plans for a military no-fly zone\" over Libya\n\n2 March: Mr Cameron is forced to defend the no-fly zone plan after US Defence Secretary Robert Gates dismisses the idea as \"loose talk\"\n\n14 March: Mr Cameron insists it is \"perfectly deliverable\" - and denies he is having trouble convincing other EU leaders, with the exception of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, of the need for one\n\n17 March: The UN Security Council votes to impose a no-fly zone over Libya\n\n19 March: The RAF begins bombing raids alongside French and US jets, with logistical support from several Arab nations\n\n21 March: MPs vote to authorise UK military action, which is backed by then Labour leader Ed Miliband\n\n21 August: Rebel fighters enter Tripoli. Mr Cameron cuts short his summer holiday in Cornwall to hold a meeting of the National Security Council and makes a statement outside Downing Street saying: \"Gaddafi must stop fighting - without conditions - and clearly show that he has given up any claim to control Libya.\"\n\n1 September: Libya's interim rulers meet world leaders in Paris to discuss reshaping Libya, as Gaddafi urges his supporters to fight on\n\n15 September: Speaking in Benghazi's Tahrir square, Mr Cameron praises the way Libya's interim authority has taken charge but warns the \"hardest part\" is still to come\n\n20 October: Gaddafi is captured and killed by rebel fighters in the city of Sirte",
        "summary": "David Cameron became distracted after 2011 challenges in Libya due to statements put out b the White House, though the UK and France lead the intervention. Cameron had distractions when making efforts to support Libya and regretted the range of issues carried out after the air campaign."

        "article": "Ten-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle fell four points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premiership with defeat by St Johnstone.\n\nSteven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee.\n\nLiam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move.\n\nAnd things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel.\n\nSaints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points.\n\nWith game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage.\n\nThey took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box.\n\nOwain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home.\n\nThey should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards.\n\nCraig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points.\n\nCummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.\n\nWith a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term.\n\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.\n\n\"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\n\"It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away.

        "article": "Ten-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle fell four points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premiership with defeat by St Johnstone.\n\nSteven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee.\n\nLiam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move.\n\nAnd things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel.\n\nSaints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points.\n\nWith game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage.\n\nThey took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box.\n\nOwain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home.\n\nThey should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards.\n\nCraig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points.\n\nCummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.\n\nWith a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term.\n\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.\n\n\"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\n\"It is not good enough. I pick the team, I pick the shape, I will take 90% of the blame for that but the players need to stand up as well.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We went in 1-0 at half-time without playing particularly well but looked a threat. We looked comfortable enough and then after the sending-off, we were ruthless. We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away. It keeps us five ahead of Hearts. It was an important result.\"\n\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3.\n\nSecond Half ends, Inverness CT 0, St. Johnstone 3.\n\nAttempt missed.

Managers can be quickly marginalised when they are out of work, which would have figured in Lennon's thinking.\n\nMost prominently, though, he would have assessed the chance to build on the sense of progress and optimism at Easter Road and pursue success in the leagues and the cups as the ideal tonic for his career.\n\nFor Hibs, Lennon represents substance and profile. He is a proven manager, at least in terms of building a first-team and motivating them to success.\n\nHibs are a contemporary club in their approach to recruitment, sports science and analysis, which might have suited other candidates better, but Lennon knows what it is to thrive and deliver under pressure.\n\nSupporters will respond to his presence, which is significant when the level of season ticket sales will determine the level of budget that is available. The club had planned for two years in the Championship, so a third campaign requires resourcefulness.\n\nLennon is a captivating figure. Fans will welcome his wholeheartedness, while his standing in the media will keep attention focused on events at Easter Road. Players have a tendency to perform under his guidance, and it would not be surprising if one or two figures considered marginal by new Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers find a welcome home in Leith.\n\nHibs have made a bold appointment, with a focus on achieving their short-term aim of return to the top-flight. Lennon is likely to fulfil their ambitions, and at the same time rejuvenate his own.",
        "summary": "Neil Lennon has been hired as the new manager for Hibernian. He has a strong background, and the team is considered to be in a strong position after two Championships. He is expected to have an easier transition than the previous manager, and step into the role of leader without complications. "

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

I'm so, so happy with my displays,\" Peaty said.\n\nHe was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third.\n\nIt was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short.\n\nThe Briton suggested \"equilibrium\" was key to his successes.\n\n\"I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best,\" he added. \"Lifestyle, family and friendships. If one is out then you are not going to be at that level.\"\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\nVan der Burgh, the 2009 and 2013 world champion in the 50m breaststroke, paid tribute to Peaty's powerful performances.\n\n\"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older,\" joked the 29-year-old.\n\n\"It's really impressive. It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast.\n\nFormer British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was \"immense\".\n\n\"There not enough words to describe how good he is,\" he said.\n\n\"Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim.\"\n\nKaren Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist\n\nWe all know how strong Peaty is.\n\nIn his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds.\n\nYou couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.\n\nWatch the full interview on BBC Radio 5 live's page\n\nRebecca Adlington, double Olympic champion at Beijing 2008\n\nHe is the poster boy for swimming across the world, not just in Britain\n\nAdam gets the biggest cheer from the crowd for a non-Hungarian for the whole meet.\n\nEveryone wants to see him do well because he's such a likeable character.\n\nNo-one is even close to him, so you ask yourself how much more can he improve.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\nWelsh swimmer Georgia Davies booked her place in Thursday's 50m backstroke final with a British record time of 27.49 seconds.\n\n\"I've not done a PB in this since the Glasgow Commonwealths in 2014,\" she told BBC Sport. \"The depth here is incredible. You can't leave anything behind.\"\n\nBrazil's Etien Medeiros was the fastest qualifier, winning the second semi-final in 27.18.\n\nDuncan Scott reached the 100m freestyle final after finishing third in his semi-final in a time of 48.10 seconds.\n\nThe 20-year-old finished behind winner Frenchman Mehdy Metella, who touched home in 47.65. United States swimmer Caleb Dressel won the other semi-final in 47.66.\n\nTeam-mate Max Litchfield reached the 200 individual medley (IM) final after finishing second in his semi-final in a time of 1:56.70. He is third fastest overall, with Japan's Kosuke Hagino, who won 400m IM gold in Rio, leading the pack after recording 1:56.04.\n\n\"We're always in the mix - it'll be a tough race,\" Litchfield told BBC Sport. \"It'll be nice to get a little bit of revenge after finishing fourth in the 400m IM at Rio 2016.\"\n\nSouth Africa's Chad le Clos stormed to victory in the 200m butterfly final in one minute 53.33 seconds. Home favourite Laszlo Cseh closed the gap to the London 2012 champion in the final few metres, but had to settle for silver.\n\nLe Clos was in tears during the medal ceremony. His father Bert, who became a celebrity because of his interviews during London 2012, and mother Geraldine were present in the Budapest arena. The pair had been receiving treatment for cancer.\n\n\"Last year, my family's health is more important than gold medals,\" said the 25-year-old swimmer, who finished fourth in the event at Rio 2016.\n\nThe biggest shock of the evening came in the 200m freestyle final where United States' Katie Ledecky lost for the first time in 13 finals when she was beaten to gold by Italy's Federica Pellegrini.",

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",
        "summary": "Leeds United striker Steve Morison expressed surprise at the chaos ruling Elland Road at the moment. This response comes after the club experienced a \"freakish set of events\" in which six players withdrew from the squad the evening before they were set to play Charlton. All cited injuries, but some connected to Leeds aren't convinced. "

        "article": "Leeds striker Steve Morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the SkyBet Championship side.\n\nSix players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road.\n\nA 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day.\n\nLeeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment.\n\nGiuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad.\n\nSouleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road.\n\n'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",
        "summary": "Leeds United has had a chaotic season, culminating in 6 players withdrawing for medical reasons. They have been met with heavy criticism, and some believe the team have become a joke. Team manager Neil Redfearn job may be in jeopardy, but he says it's just been a series of unrelated events."

        "article": "North Charleston police are facing growing accusations that killer cop Michael Slager would have got away with a cover up had a bystander video not emerged - as questions emerge over his colleagues' conduct after the shooting.\n\nSeven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back.\n\nBut the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting.\n\nOfficers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body.\n\nOne officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nQuestions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR.\n\nScott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.'\n\nSlager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened.\n\n'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said.\n\n'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.'\n\nOn Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation.\n\nThere are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows.\n\nIt is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation.\n\nThe video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham\u00a0was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground.\n\nAs Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body.\n\nHaberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away.\n\nRadio records show that an officer\u00a0reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back.\u00a0Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down.\n\nThe same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed\u00a0is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.'\n\nAftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.'\n\nHe says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead.\n\nThere is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR.\n\nA second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR.\n\nSix other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report.\n\nThey were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb.\n\nThey all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later.\n\nGann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day.\n\nEdward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings.\n\nHe said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years.

        "article": "North Charleston police are facing growing accusations that killer cop Michael Slager would have got away with a cover up had a bystander video not emerged - as questions emerge over his colleagues' conduct after the shooting.\n\nSeven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back.\n\nBut the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting.\n\nOfficers also told an internal report that they gave Scott CPR, but the video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body.\n\nOne officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nQuestions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR.\n\nScott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.'\n\nSlager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened.\n\n'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said.\n\n'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.'\n\nOn Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation.\n\nThere are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows.\n\nIt is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation.\n\nThe video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham\u00a0was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground.\n\nAs Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body.\n\nHaberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away.\n\nRadio records show that an officer\u00a0reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back.\u00a0Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down.\n\nThe same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed\u00a0is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.'\n\nAftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.'\n\nHe says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead.\n\nThere is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR.\n\nA second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR.\n\nSix other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report.\n\nThey were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb.\n\nThey all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later.\n\nGann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day.\n\nEdward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings.\n\nHe said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years. There is a code of conduct to cover their behinds. We call it Code Blue.'\n\nMarc Moria, President of the\u00a0president of the National Urban League, told the Washington Post: 'But for this video, this would have been another coverup, another fabrication, another lie told by a police officer when the police officer was clearly in the wrong.'\n\nThe discrepancies were also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough said: 'That cop is two feet away when he dropped the taser next to the dead body.

For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground.\n\nAt first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.\n\nNow I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.\n\nBlogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people.\n\nTwitter: Nawara Negm\n\nI'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.\n\nThe internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger.\n\nIn the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.\n\nBlog: MaLek X (in Arabic)\n\nThe revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far.\n\nTo begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.\n\nAfter our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.\n\nStill the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years.\"\n\nPeople have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.\n\nIn the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.\n\nWe're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.",
        "summary": "The internet has helped give voice and coordinate the pro-democracy movement in Egypt amid government backlash. Some are calling it the Facebook Revolution, because it has enabled protestors to communicate freely and plan their protests. Now, as the movement advances and develops, the internet continues to play an important role in other ways. "

        "article": "Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.\n\nThis revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since.\n\nOur social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.\n\nI like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.\n\nThis is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.\n\nAt the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through.\n\nI hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.\n\nTwitter: Amr Gharbeia\n\nI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground.\n\nAt first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.\n\nNow I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.\n\nBlogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people.\n\nTwitter: Nawara Negm\n\nI'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.\n\nThe internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger.\n\nIn the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.

As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the opioid crisis in rural Scott, Indiana, has grown. The culprit, a prescription opioid called Opana, is being used interveineously by residents. Both the lack of clean needles and the composition of the drug itself has contributed to a startling string of new HIV infections."

It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",

The division also investigated an incident in which eight prisoners were confined overnight to a housing cell that had been sprayed with a riot control agent, the Navy said. The six guards will face courts-martial. Seven other cases have been resolved through nonjudicial punishment, according to a statement from the commander of U.S. Naval Forces-Central Command. The courts-martial are expected to start within 30 days at Camp Bucca, which is in southern Iraq near the Kuwaiti border. The guards accused in the case are assigned to Navy Provisional Detainee Battalion 4.",

In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.\"",
        "summary": "A 40-year inquest has been halted due to the lack of a coroner. Only one coroner was left in Northern Ireland after the senior coroner retired. Families of the victims are demanding justice. The county is now appointing judges as coroners.   "

The works at Nottingham Castle include a chalk portrait of St Anne, sketches of bodies and plants, plus some technical drawings. The artist made only around 20 paintings during his lifetime, including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, but left many more drawings. In total, there are almost 600 drawings by da Vinci in the Royal Collection. They were originally bound into a single album, thought to have been acquired in the 17th Century by Charles II. Experts believe Leonardo's drawings are the richest, most wide-ranging and most technically brilliant of any artist. The exhibition is on show at Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery until 9 October.",
