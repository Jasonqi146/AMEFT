He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing.\n\nUsers can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK.\n\nThere is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\"\n\nHowever, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\".\n\n\"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy.\n\n\"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\".\n\nSue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\".\n\nShe said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\".\n\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\"\n\n\"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.",

At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger\u2019s side.\n\nCharlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nLike Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town.\n\nSoon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder.\n\nThe Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season.\n\n\u2018We just want what\u2019s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,\u2019 said dad Julio on Wednesday.\n\n\u2018He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.\u2019\n\nCharlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. \u2018Other parents have commented on it in the past,\u2019 admitted Julio.\n\nThe big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA\u2019s compensation guidelines.\n\nThe transfer fee involved is \u00a310,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton.\n\nThere are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision.\n\nCharlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost \u00a310,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton.\n\n11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona.\n\nJulio\u2019s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports.\n\nJulio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: \u2018Charlie doesn\u2019t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.\u2019\n\nCharlie\u2019s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents\u2019 home in London Colney, Hertfordshire.\n\nSoon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball.\n\nHe has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton\u2019s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club.\n\nJulio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London\u2019s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago.\n\nCharlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball.\n\nHe trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road)\n\nThe Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time.\n\n\u2018Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,\u2019 added his dad. \u2018He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.\u2019\n\nThe Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club\u2019s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed.\n\nJulio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club.\n\n\u2018Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,\u2019 he added. \u2018They have really looked after Charlie over the years.\u2019\n\nThe Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.",

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene.\n\nThis no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them.\n\nArsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final.\n\nFabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley.\n\nWembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes.\n\nPrior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion.\n\nAlongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal.\n\nWell, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement.\n\nReading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros.\n\nAnd then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special.\n\nReading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle.\n\nCome Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion.\n\nThis was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end!\n\nFormer Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful.\n\nFrom the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be.\n\nIt was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time.\n\nYet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you.\n\nMuch of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport.",

'Tommy's is blue,' she added.\n\nJail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.\n\nSchaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered.\n\nThe couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit.\n\nThey tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel.\n\nMack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.\n\nMack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer\u2019s attack with the metal bowl.\n\nShe said they thought about\u00a0either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate.

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",
        "output": "The Liberal Democrats are optimistic about winning across the country, but polls and ratings have narrow margins and conflicting results.

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\"\n\nShe has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.\n\nHere are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.\n\nSuper Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.\n\nNot Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.\n\nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\n\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeat that, Gaga.\n\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\n\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\n\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\n\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\n\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\n\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\n\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\n\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\n\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\n\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\n\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\n\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\n\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\n\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\n\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\n\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\n\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\n\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\n\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\n\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\n\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\n\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.'\n\nRather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.\n\nThe op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nOn Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.\n\n'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.\n\n'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.'\n\nWhile appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",
        "output": "Faculty at Columbia University have written an op-ed to denounce the non-evidence-based medical recommendations given on the talk show hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Dr. Oz is employed at the Ivy League school where he serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the College of Physicians."

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time.

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",
        "output": "The Liberal Democrats are optimistic about winning across the country, but polls and ratings have narrow margins and conflicting results. Without a clear poll leader, Liberal Democrats are campaigning hard, stating they are the best way to keep balance, not swinging too far right or left. "

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\"\n\nShe has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.\n\nHere are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.\n\nSuper Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.\n\nNot Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.\n\nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\n\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeat that, Gaga.\n\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\n\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\n\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\n\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\n\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\n\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\n\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\n\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\n\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\n\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\n\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\n\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\n\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\n\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\n\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\n\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\n\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\n\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\n\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\n\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\n\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\n\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content.

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the opioid crisis in rural Scott, Indiana, has grown. The culprit, a prescription opioid called Opana, is being used interveineously by residents. Both the lack of clean needles and the composition of the drug itself has contributed to a startling string of new HIV infections."

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

        "input": "A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim.\n\nAt the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nHydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy. This method would allow eco-friendly energy sources like wind to be stored and used as a chemical energy source. "

It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

        "input": "The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.\n\nBHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product.

An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive?

        "input": "The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.\n\nBHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",
        "output": "Potential investors are deciding the fate of BHS, a failing department store with 164 locations. There are several ultra-rich businessmen who have made bids, although the details vary and no deal has been made.

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",
        "output": "Rick Burns won the Super-Lightweight title becoming the first Scot to win titles at three different weights. The fight was stopped in the eighth round after Burns' opponent was deemed unfit to continue by medical staff. Burns has little left to achieve in the sport.  "

Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit.

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand?

All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating.

Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it.

Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",

He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him.\n\n'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.'\n\nFellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby.\n\nUnited are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.\n\n'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney.\n\n'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in.\n\n'We have been working really hard.\n\n'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.'\n\n'We are confident going to Chelsea.\n\n'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea.\n\nLouis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth.\n\n'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can.\n\n'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue.\n\n'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "Indiana declared a public health emergency due to high numbers of new HIV infections in rural counties. The spread is believed to be from sharing needles by those abusing a prescription opioid medication. The CDC has established a clinic and provided assistance and education in hopes of stopping the spread. "

The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

He has been amazing, taking things on to another level.\n\nRedknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club.\n\nThe Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining.\n\n'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch.

A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "Scientists have developed a new material that can generate hydrogen from water. The process is more efficient at minimizing energy loss and is an exciting discovery for the future of sustainable energy. "

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.'\n\nRather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.\n\nThe op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nOn Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.\n\n'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.\n\n'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.'\n\nWhile appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",

A reading below 50 indicates falling output.\n\nIt is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013.\n\nFirms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\nA slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production.\n\nThe index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.\n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\n\n\"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector.\n\nDavid Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality.\n\n\"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.\n\n\"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\"\n\nThe Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",
        "output": "UK manufacturing has contracted for the first time in three years. Soft domestic demand, a slowing domestic energy market, and political uncertainty have all been cited as potential causes.

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",
        "output": "Mead, an alcoholic beverage made from honey is gaining popularity in the United States. The drink is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Mead labels define it as \"honey wine\", giving the consumer the impression that every mead is sweet, but it can also be flavored with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers. "

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",

The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",
        "output": "The MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas is preparing for the fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao, which is expected to be the biggest boxing contest ever. Hundreds of thousands of fans are expected, and the event planners are focusing on safety, security, and ensuring there is enough food and alcohol."

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",

At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger\u2019s side.\n\nCharlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nLike Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town.\n\nSoon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder.\n\nThe Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season.\n\n\u2018We just want what\u2019s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,\u2019 said dad Julio on Wednesday.\n\n\u2018He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.\u2019\n\nCharlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. \u2018Other parents have commented on it in the past,\u2019 admitted Julio.\n\nThe big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA\u2019s compensation guidelines.\n\nThe transfer fee involved is \u00a310,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton.\n\nThere are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision.\n\nCharlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost \u00a310,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton.\n\n11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona.\n\nJulio\u2019s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports.\n\nJulio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: \u2018Charlie doesn\u2019t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.\u2019\n\nCharlie\u2019s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents\u2019 home in London Colney, Hertfordshire.\n\nSoon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball.\n\nHe has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton\u2019s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club.\n\nJulio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London\u2019s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago.\n\nCharlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball.\n\nHe trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road)\n\nThe Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time.\n\n\u2018Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,\u2019 added his dad. \u2018He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.\u2019\n\nThe Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club\u2019s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed.\n\nJulio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club.\n\n\u2018Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,\u2019 he added. \u2018They have really looked after Charlie over the years.\u2019\n\nThe Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.",

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.

It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",
        "output": "During the Sky Bet Championship, Wigan and Millwall teams engaged in a heated clash. Two confrontations erupted in the first half, and eventually, three players were sent off from the game. Millwall's coaching staff noted that lacking a strong referee led to the game getting even more out of it than in the second half."

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.'\n\nRather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.\n\nThe op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nOn Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.\n\n'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.\n\n'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.'\n\nWhile appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again.

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke.

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens.

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",

I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",
        "output": "Leeds United has had a chaotic season, culminating in 6 players withdrawing for medical reasons. They have been met with heavy criticism, and some believe the team have become a joke. Team manager Neil Redfearn job may be in jeopardy, but he says it's just been a series of unrelated events."

        "input": "Sweet life: The Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall has created a buzz with the launch of her own honey, produced in late spring by the bees in her Wiltshire garden.\n\nJust 250 jars are being produced, at \u00a320 each, with all proceeds going to charity.\n\nBut Camilla\u2019s venture reflects a rocketing demand for gourmet honey. Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5.\n\nRoyal winner: Camilla\u2019s honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile'\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey.\n\n\u00a35.10 for 227g, Waitrose.\n\nPROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.\n\nVERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles\u2019s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.\n\n\u00a314.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards. Now I\u2019ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka.\n\n\u00a329.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting version and Britain\u2019s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "output": "The gourmet honey industry is small but growing, and it seems there is room for new producers. The Duchess of Cornwall has produced a small, limited batch to raise funds for charity, and gets raving reviews even when compared to other gourmet specialty honeys. "

At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger\u2019s side.\n\nCharlie Patino, 11, and his family must weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nLike Arsenal star Jack Wilshere he is a talented midfelder who has been spotted at Luton Town.\n\nSoon it will be decision time for another Luton discovery as 11-year-old Charlie Patino and his parents Julio and Katy weigh up offers from Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. Like Jack, he is a midfielder.\n\nThe Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season.\n\n\u2018We just want what\u2019s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,\u2019 said dad Julio on Wednesday.\n\n\u2018He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.\u2019\n\nCharlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. \u2018Other parents have commented on it in the past,\u2019 admitted Julio.\n\nThe big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA\u2019s compensation guidelines.\n\nThe transfer fee involved is \u00a310,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton.\n\nThere are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision.\n\nCharlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost \u00a310,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton.\n\n11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona.\n\nJulio\u2019s parents are both Spanish.

His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.\u2019\n\nCharlie\u2019s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents\u2019 home in London Colney, Hertfordshire.\n\nSoon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball.\n\nHe has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton\u2019s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club.\n\nJulio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London\u2019s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago.\n\nCharlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball.\n\nHe trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road)\n\nThe Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time.\n\n\u2018Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,\u2019 added his dad. \u2018He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.\u2019\n\nThe Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club\u2019s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed.\n\nJulio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club.\n\n\u2018Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,\u2019 he added. \u2018They have really looked after Charlie over the years.\u2019\n\nThe Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.",

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

There's lots of families.\n\n\"It's not just about massive headlining acts. And it's not going to be a swamp of corporate beer-swilling drunkards.\n\n\"There's rain and there's mud but it's new and it doesn't smell bad yet. It's like, 'oh, this mud smells like grass! It's spring!'\"\n\nThe music continues on Saturday with Jake Bugg, Pixies, Clean Bandit and Manic Street Preachers on the bill.\n\nAmong those watching the action will be Hollywood star Bradley Cooper, who told the BBC: \"I'm excited to see Metallica and I want to see Jack White and Lana Del Rey.\"\n\nAsked if he was put off by the weather, the Hangover star replied: \"I love it. I do! But I'm a dumb American - you expect it.\"\n\nGlastonbury 2014",

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked.

The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",

        "input": "Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes.\n\nThe popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell.\n\nBut for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters.\n\nThe child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",
        "output": "Researchers are studying synaesthesia, a neurological condition where two or more sense become connected and experienced together. Studies indicate that a person can be born with it, learn it through repeated cultural exposure, or even develop it after a stroke or after taking hallucinogenic drugs. "

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the opioid crisis in rural Scott, Indiana, has grown. The culprit, a prescription opioid called Opana, is being used interveineously by residents. Both the lack of clean needles and the composition of the drug itself has contributed to a startling string of new HIV infections."

The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ...

Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion.

        "input": "Sweet life: The Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall has created a buzz with the launch of her own honey, produced in late spring by the bees in her Wiltshire garden.\n\nJust 250 jars are being produced, at \u00a320 each, with all proceeds going to charity.\n\nBut Camilla\u2019s venture reflects a rocketing demand for gourmet honey. Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5.\n\nRoyal winner: Camilla\u2019s honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile'\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey.\n\n\u00a35.10 for 227g, Waitrose.\n\nPROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.\n\nVERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles\u2019s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.\n\n\u00a314.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards.

Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "output": "The gourmet honey industry is small but growing, and it seems there is room for new producers. The Duchess of Cornwall has produced a small, limited batch to raise funds for charity, and gets raving reviews even when compared to other gourmet specialty honeys. "

Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating.

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you?

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover.

Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.\n\nVERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles\u2019s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.\n\n\u00a314.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards.

Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside.

        "input": "A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim.\n\nAt the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nHydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy. This method would allow eco-friendly energy sources like wind to be stored and used as a chemical energy source. "

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked.

He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney.

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating.

They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue.

Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it.

Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle.

It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "output": "The Duchess of Cornwall Honey is a little bit more expensive than most honey products, which is why a test was conducted to compare and justify its price. As promised, the Duchess of Cornwall Honey has higher quality than most of the cheaper brands. In addition, all proceeds will go to charity. "

        "input": "A report about a woman who said she had repeated plastic surgery after her husband divorced her because she had a \"fat face\" has sparked outrage among China's online community.\n\nThough the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, \"divorced because of fat face\" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo.\n\nState media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week.\n\nLiaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\".\n\nShe said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape.\n\nDuring the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure.\n\nThe woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages.\n\nShe alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\".\n\nThe hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused.\n\nAfter mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report.\n\nOn Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman.\n\nOne top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",
        "output": "A woman claiming to have undergone repeated plastic surgery after her husband divorced her for having a \"fat face\" has gone viral on Weibo. The woman surnamed Wang, underwent three rounds of face-slimming surgery before doctors halted the fourth round citing fears of permanent nerve damage.  "

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter\u00a0Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past.\n\nAfter questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview.\n\nChannel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life.\n\nIn the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.\n\nThe American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal.\n\nSeemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.\n\nAt that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].'\n\nThe horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat.\n\nBut Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives.\n\nJustin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nAnd Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.\n\nHere are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:.\n\nThe model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given.\n\nNAOMI CAMPBELL.\n\nIn April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way.\n\nThe reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.\n\nNaomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.'\n\nThe interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.\n\nIn court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.\n\nRobert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart.\n\nROBERT PATTINSON.\n\nWhen Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest.\n\nRyan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart.\n\nRyan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.\n\nRob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off.\n\nAs Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension.\n\nJustin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER.\n\nIn 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning.\n\nThe host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nJustin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.'\n\nHe then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.\n\nThe presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'\n\nThe radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.",

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens.

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\n\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\n\nNo, that's Julian Assange.",

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",
        "output": "Aubrey de Gray believes that humans can live to be thousands of years old in the near future.  He has secured funding from tech billionaires to conduct research. His basic premise is humans will be able to change out their organs and clean up their cells in order to increase their longevity. "

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",
        "output": "An England investigation found that at least nine Clinical Commissioning Groups were offering doctors incentives to reduce the number of outpatient referrals and follow-ups. This is in an effort by the NHS to reduce inappropriate referrals and cut health service expenses. "

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",
        "output": "Retailer BHS is flailing and other companies are bidding on it to save it from bankruptcy. The leading bidder is Greg Tufnell, however, if a deal cannot be struck the business will be liquidated. The next closest bidder is Matalan founder Mr. Hargreaves.  "

It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

That was it.

They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said.\n\n'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said.\n\nThe school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms.\n\nThe usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor.\n\n'I left my house which was the only thing I had.

They beat me until I passed out and left me for dead,' he added, referring to the group by an Arabic acronym.\n\nAt the entrance to the school, Umm Usama chatted with fellow refugees who had got out.\n\n'I left the camp despite myself,' said the 40-year-old woman who had lived in Yarmouk for 17 years.\n\n'I'd stayed on despite the bombings and famine. It was terrible, we ate grass, but at least I was at home.\n\n'Daesh's arrival meant destruction and massacre.

Before that we didn't fear death, because if there was fighting, the rebels made sure the civilians got to shelters,' said Abir, a 47-year-old woman who was born and raised in Yarmouk.\n\nThere are no suitcases to be seen in the classrooms -- the families had to leave so quickly there was no time to pack anything.\n\n'I left without bringing any belongings.

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

        "input": "In telly terms, the FA Cup has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a 'journey\u2019 this season. This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene.\n\nThis no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them.\n\nArsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final.\n\nFabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley.\n\nWembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes.\n\nPrior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion.\n\nAlongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal.\n\nWell, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement.\n\nReading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros.\n\nAnd then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special.\n\nReading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle.\n\nCome Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion.\n\nThis was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end!\n\nFormer Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful.\n\nFrom the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be.\n\nIt was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time.\n\nYet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you.\n\nMuch of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport.",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",
        "output": "Retailer BHS is flailing and other companies are bidding on it to save it from bankruptcy. The leading bidder is Greg Tufnell, however, if a deal cannot be struck the business will be liquidated. The next closest bidder is Matalan founder Mr. Hargreaves.  "

There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",
        "output": "The MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas is preparing for the fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao, which is expected to be the biggest boxing contest ever. Hundreds of thousands of fans are expected, and the event planners are focusing on safety, security, and ensuring there is enough food and alcohol."

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe.

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\"\n\nShe has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.\n\nHere are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.\n\nSuper Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.\n\nNot Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.\n\nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\n\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeat that, Gaga.\n\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\n\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\n\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\n\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\n\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\n\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\n\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\n\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\n\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\n\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\n\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\n\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\n\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\n\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\n\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\n\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\n\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\n\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\n\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\n\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\n\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\n\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",
        "output": "Author of the classic book To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee describes why she never wrote another book. Lee, 84, cited a lack of privacy and saying everything she needed to say in her one book as the reasons. Her book was disliked in her hometown.   "

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

        "input": "A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim.\n\nAt the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nHydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy. This method would allow eco-friendly energy sources like wind to be stored and used as a chemical energy source. "

I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens.

He just loves it.\u2019\n\nCharlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. \u2018Other parents have commented on it in the past,\u2019 admitted Julio.\n\nThe big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA\u2019s compensation guidelines.\n\nThe transfer fee involved is \u00a310,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton.\n\nThere are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision.\n\nCharlie, pictured with his sister Lily and dog Truffles, would cost \u00a310,000 and is a season ticket holder at Luton.\n\n11-year-old analyses Spanish football and his style of play has been influenced by favourite team Barcelona.\n\nJulio\u2019s parents are both Spanish. They moved to England in the Sixties before their son was born in England. Charlie watches live La Liga games on Sky Sports.\n\nJulio, who is a supporter of La Liga strugglers Deportivo La Coruna, added: \u2018Charlie doesn\u2019t watch the Spanish football, he analyses it. His mind is ticking away, watching the player movements and asking why they made certain decisions. He is very intelligent. He would say his favourite team is Barcelona and he has definitely been influenced as a player by the Spanish style of football.\u2019\n\nCharlie\u2019s formal training began at the age of five when he joined St Albans City Youth, a team close to his parents\u2019 home in London Colney, Hertfordshire.\n\nSoon enough he was invited to play for Luton, often playing in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability with the ball.\n\nHe has a superior touch and a great feel for the ball, making the game appear effortless. He trains six times a week, spending more than 10 hours a week playing in various age groups at Luton\u2019s highly respected academy before playing a game on a Sunday for the club.\n\nJulio, who works in the telecommunications industry, and mum Katy, who works for Marks & Spencer, insist their son has been unaffected by the interest from London\u2019s three biggest clubs, who made their initial moves a few months ago.\n\nCharlie has often played in age groups one or two years above because of his outstanding ability on the ball.\n\nHe trains six hours a week, spending more than 10 hours a week at Luton (pictured Kenilworth Road)\n\nThe Patino family have already visited the training grounds of Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea with their son, listening to the sales pitches and making it clear that they will take their time.\n\n\u2018Charlie is only 11 but he gets it and he knows what is happening to him,\u2019 added his dad. \u2018He knows that this is a big opportunity to train with a top club, even though there are no guarantees at the end of it.\u2019\n\nThe Patinos have been guided through the process by Luton, with the club\u2019s chief executive Gary Sweet making sure that they have been kept fully informed.\n\nJulio intends to continue to take his son to Kenilworth Road next season even though Charlie will be settling into his new club.\n\n\u2018Everybody at Luton has been fantastic and it is a very impressive set-up,\u2019 he added. \u2018They have really looked after Charlie over the years.\u2019\n\nThe Patino family live near London Colney and have visited Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea's training grounds.",

That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back.\n\nUnshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army.\n\n'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said.\n\n'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said.\n\nThe school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms.\n\nThe usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor.\n\n'I left my house which was the only thing I had. My family lived on rations supplied by UNRWA,' the United Nations agency that looks after Palestinian refugees, the former caretaker said.\n\nDestroyed: In late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began.\n\nA man stands on a staircase inside a demolished building inside the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp.\n\nAnwar Abdel Hadi, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Damascus, said 500 families, or about 2,500 people, fled Yarmouk before IS fighters attacked the camp last Wednesday.\n\nBefore the assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital.\n\nYarmouk was once a thriving district housing 160,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians. But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011.\n\nIn late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began.\n\nThe camp has been encircled for more than a year, but is now reported to be almost completely under the control of ISIS and Al Qaeda's local affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nResidents who fled the advancing jihadists last week have been put up in regime-held areas nearby.\n\nAccording to Britain-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nearly 200 people had died in Yarmouk from malnutrition and lack of medicines before last Wednesday's assault.\n\nCarnage:\u00a0Before the Islamic State assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus.\n\nKeeping the faith: A Palestinian man who fled the Yarmouk  refugee camp prays inside a school in Damascus.\n\nSpeaking of the moment he stumbled on the ISIS militants, 16-year-old Amjad said:\u00a0'In Palestine Street, I saw two members of Daesh playing with a severed head as if it was a football.\n\nWearing a baseball cap sideways, rapper-style, the youth has a swollen eye and chin.\n\n'Daesh came to my home looking for my brother who's in the Palestinian Popular Committees.

Before that we didn't fear death, because if there was fighting, the rebels made sure the civilians got to shelters,' said Abir, a 47-year-old woman who was born and raised in Yarmouk.\n\nThere are no suitcases to be seen in the classrooms -- the families had to leave so quickly there was no time to pack anything.\n\n'I left without bringing any belongings.

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",
        "output": "Scottish Ricky Burns entered Glasgow's Hydra fights as the underdog, but emerged victorious after 8 rounds, earning the title of WBA World Super-Lightweight Champion. Despite his win, he remains notably humble, and looks forward to future fight opportunities. "

It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",

Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",

Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic.\n\nThis contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough.\n\nBilly Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley.\n\nGreg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net.\n\nTheir best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus.\n\nCole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul.\n\nSt Johnstone were merciless and could have had more.\n\nWith just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble.\n\nTommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage.\n\nThey took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box.\n\nOwain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home.\n\nThey should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards.\n\nCraig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points.\n\nCummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.\n\nWith a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term.\n\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.\n\n\"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire. We controlled aspects of the game without having that ruthless edge to it. I don't think we believed today.\n\n\"The main person who is not good enough is me. I am obviously not doing my job right and big apologies to the supporters. I believe we let them down today.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\n\"It is not good enough.

We scored two and maybe could have scored two or three more.\n\n\"The attitude to go and kick on and make sure we got that second goal, to make sure we weren't having any problems in the last few minutes, was excellent.\n\n\"It's been a week that didn't start so well that's ended absolutely magnificently for us. We enjoy defending. We don't panic when we're under pressure. We're a good side that can do both sides of the game.\n\n\"There's a better chance tonight (of finishing third) but we're not going to get carried away. We'll just keep working away.

        "input": "The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised.\n\nThey call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check.\n\nThere is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light.\n\nPeople in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nResidents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. \u00a0Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial.\n\nThe officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two.

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",

They have been met with heavy criticism, and some believe the team have become a joke. Team manager Neil Redfearn job may be in jeopardy, but he says it's just been a series of unrelated events."

He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again.

The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the opioid crisis in rural Scott, Indiana, has grown. The culprit, a prescription opioid called Opana, is being used interveineously by residents. Both the lack of clean needles and the composition of the drug itself has contributed to a startling string of new HIV infections."

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene.\n\nThis no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them.\n\nArsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final.\n\nFabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley.\n\nWembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes.\n\nPrior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion.\n\nAlongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal.\n\nWell, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement.\n\nReading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros.\n\nAnd then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special.\n\nReading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle.\n\nCome Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion.\n\nThis was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end!\n\nFormer Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful.\n\nFrom the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be.\n\nIt was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time.\n\nYet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you.\n\nMuch of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport.",

His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words.

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce!

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",
        "output": "Retailer BHS is flailing and other companies are bidding on it to save it from bankruptcy. The leading bidder is Greg Tufnell, however, if a deal cannot be struck the business will be liquidated. The next closest bidder is Matalan founder Mr. Hargreaves.  "

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",
        "output": "Mead, an alcoholic beverage made from honey is gaining popularity in the United States. The drink is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.'\n\nRather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said.\n\nThe op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nOn Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show.\n\n'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said.\n\n'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.'\n\nWhile appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",
        "output": "Faculty at Columbia University have written an op-ed to denounce the non-evidence-based medical recommendations given on the talk show hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz.

The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.'\n\nAftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.'\n\nHe says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead.\n\nThere is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR.\n\nA second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR.\n\nSix other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report.\n\nThey were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb.\n\nThey all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later.\n\nGann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day.\n\nEdward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings.\n\nHe said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years. There is a code of conduct to cover their behinds. We call it Code Blue.'\n\nMarc Moria, President of the\u00a0president of the National Urban League, told the Washington Post: 'But for this video, this would have been another coverup, another fabrication, another lie told by a police officer when the police officer was clearly in the wrong.'\n\nThe discrepancies were also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough said: 'That cop is two feet away when he dropped the taser next to the dead body. I'm sorry, what cop is okay with that?'\n\nMika Brzezinski added: 'There should be more charges'\n\nAfter Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and terminated from the North Charleston Police on Wednesday, his department released his personnel file.\n\nSome 100 pages including his job application, training records, firearm test scores and work appraisals were published online.\n\nAmong the details were that Slager had graduated from\u00a0Lenape High School in Medford, N.J, in 2001 and was a waiter at an Italian restaurant before he joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2003.\n\nHe spent six years with the Coast Guard working as a mechanic and engineer and then became involved in security on board vessels.\n\nHe was hired by the North Charleston Police Department in December 2009 and attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy for a nine-week training course.\n\nMajor Florence McCants told Yahoo News\u00a0that Slager 'didn't create any issues nor was he an award winner in any of the categories'.\n\nSlager also took course in first-aid and use of a Taser, according to his personnel records.",
        "output": "A North Charleston Police Officer was charged with murder after a video went public showing him shooting an unarmed black man in the back and failing to provide CPR. His actions do not match his, and other responding officers reports, and is considered an attempted coverup. "

        "input": "Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.\n\nBut what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe.\n\n\"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.\n\nWhen no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel.\n\n\"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge.\n\n\"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",
        "output": "Mead is making a comeback in the US. Brewers are revamping old recipes in order to make the drink less sweet. Mead brewers are also battling an image problem where mead is classified as a sweet wine or something only Vikings drink.  "

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked.

There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",
        "output": "The MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas is preparing for the fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao, which is expected to be the biggest boxing contest ever.

Sales of high-end versions are up by 45 per cent at Selfridges since last year.\n\nDoes luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag, though?\n\nAnd how does Camilla\u2019s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals \u2014 including her husband\u2019s Duchy brand? We tested the best-selling gourmet honeys to find out...\n\nDuchess of Cornwall Honey.\n\n\u00a320 for 227g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: The Duchess\u2019s late-spring honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile\u2019 and billed as \u2018the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days, or for sweetening tea\u2019. All proceeds go to the Medical Detection Dogs charity, of which the Duchess is patron.\n\nVERDICT: This tastefully packaged little jar, decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee, has a handwritten number on the back. It contains a clear, golden, liquid honey, and when I open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils. When you ooze it over buttered bread, it\u2019s impossible to stop eating. Delicate, delicious and the perfect gift for any honey-lover. A royal winner. 5/5.\n\nRoyal winner: Camilla\u2019s honey is made from \u2018delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile'\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey.\n\n\u00a35.10 for 227g, Waitrose.\n\nPROMISE: Heathers growing on the Crown Estate in Balmoral produce the nectar for this honey. Beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste, and this is a combination of two types of heather, Bell and Ling.\n\nVERDICT: Open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight. Camilla may have set the bar high but Prince Charles\u2019s answer is also rather beautiful and rare. It has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste. 3/5.\n\nDuchy Originals Scottish Heather Honey has a thick, velvety, sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey.\n\n\u00a314.95 for 325g, wedderspoon.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Wild Rata trees grow on high land in New Zealand. They flower sporadically, so the nectar is extremely rare. The honey is kept at a low temperature \u2014 the same as that of a beehive \u2014 to preserve natural enzymes, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.\n\nVERDICT: Did you ever think honey could taste like a Christmas tree? Take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and, seconds later, a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue. This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards.

Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it.

Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",
        "output": "The gourmet honey industry is small but growing, and it seems there is room for new producers. The Duchess of Cornwall has produced a small, limited batch to raise funds for charity, and gets raving reviews even when compared to other gourmet specialty honeys. "

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "Indiana declared a public health emergency due to high numbers of new HIV infections in rural counties. The spread is believed to be from sharing needles by those abusing a prescription opioid medication. The CDC has established a clinic and provided assistance and education in hopes of stopping the spread. "

He has been amazing, taking things on to another level.\n\nRedknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club.\n\nThe Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining.\n\n'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch.\n\n'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.'\n\nRedknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year.\n\nHe said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause.\n\n'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.'\n\nRedknapp \u00a0lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer.\n\nPeople are being urged to search Men United and do something great with their mates via prostatecanceruk.org/menunited.

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019.\n\nMARCH 2014.\n\nEngland suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20.

The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 \u2014 in a one-off Test match.\n\nJULY-AUG 2014.\n\nEngland lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1.

'Tommy's is blue,' she added.\n\nJail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.\n\nSchaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered.\n\nThe couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit.\n\nThey tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel.\n\nMack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.\n\nMack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer\u2019s attack with the metal bowl.\n\nShe said they thought about\u00a0either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one.\n\nWhen the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her.\n\nShortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly.\n\nMack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years.\n\nThe baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice.\n\nThe child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother.\n\nMack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old.\n\nShe revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.",

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",
        "output": "Aubrey de Gray believes that humans can live to be thousands of years old in the near future.  He has secured funding from tech billionaires to conduct research. His basic premise is humans will be able to change out their organs and clean up their cells in order to increase their longevity. "

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.\n\n\"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that.

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him.\n\n'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.'\n\nFellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby.\n\nUnited are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.\n\n'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney.\n\n'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in.\n\n'We have been working really hard.\n\n'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.'\n\n'We are confident going to Chelsea.\n\n'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea.\n\nLouis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth.\n\n'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can.\n\n'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue.\n\n'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack.

This creamy, firm-set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products (out of 10,000) in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019, the Great Taste Awards. Now I\u2019ve tried it, that comes as no surprise. 4/5.\n\nWedderspoon Gold Organic Rata Honey scooped a place in the top 50 products in the \u2018food Oscars\u2019\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka.\n\n\u00a329.95 for 113g, tregothnan.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Although manuka is generally expensive, this is a more normal-tasting version and Britain\u2019s costliest home-grown honey. Most manuka plants grow in New Zealand but bushes have been growing, hidden behind a garden wall, on the Tregothnan estate in Cornwall since 1880.\n\nBees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state-of-the-art, six-foot hives, which cost \u00a35,000 each. There is only a limited supply made, hence the hefty price tag.\n\nVERDICT: This honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every teaspoon is expensive. Yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans.\n\nThe jar opens to reveal a light, cream-coloured honey with an almost-white crust. Dip your spoon in to discover solid, set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar. I used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it. A treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. 4/5.\n\nTregothnan Cornish Floral Manuka honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars, so every spoonful is pricey.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey with Edible Gold Leaf.\n\n\u00a339.99 for 250g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: Produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of Evia, this honey is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nThe small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom, infusing it with the flavour of the herb. Greek honey is said to be among the best in the world, thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers, long sunny days and ancient, organic production methods.\n\nVERDICT: The shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey-lover. It looks so good, I don\u2019t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight.\n\nThe beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special, and when I unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume.\n\nInside is a smooth, dark-gold honey that tastes like treacle. The experts who hand-make it say the flavour changes subtly each year; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage. Tasting this, I can see why they call honey the food of the gods. 5/5.\n\nVasilissa Greek Honey  is trickled with 24-carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: This is made by a small producer in northern Spain, still using the same traditional methods after five generations.\n\nThe nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains, and the resulting herb-infused honey has a high iron content. It is said to be particularly good for the digestion, and as an aid to relaxation.\n\nVERDICT: This is the honey equivalent of a soft-boiled egg. Dip your spoon in for oozing, runny honey in the middle, but enjoy the crunch of the pale, crystallised honey at the sides. It\u2019s very mild \u2014 there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls.\n\nIt does gives a rather surprising aftertaste, though. This is my daughter Ruby\u2019s favourite honey \u2014 she describes it as the best of both worlds, for its double consistency. 4/5.\n\nAlemany Rosemary Honey uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the Montsec mountains.\n\nWelsh Chunk Honeycomb Amphora.\n\n\u00a321 for 908g, Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPROMISE: Clear Welsh honey with a gentle fruity flavour. The delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture. Gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in mid-Wales.\n\nVERDICT: This looks impressive \u2014 a huge glass jar with golden, syrupy honey and a huge, striking honeycomb in the middle, sparkling like a jewel.\n\nThe Fortnum & Mason label adds to the impression of real quality. What a disappointment, then, to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax.\n\nThe chewy mass is like old gum. I spit it out \u2014 as does my honey-loving son Charlie, who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own-brand honey we usually buy. Proof that paying more doesn\u2019t always guarantee a pot of gold. 1/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey.\n\n\u00a319.99 for 227g, selfridges.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: The starflower is another name for the borage plant (which sounds much less exotic). But this herbal flower is rich in calcium, vitamin C and potassium. It is used to strengthen adrenal functions, and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases. This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas. This is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree, so it has a slightly bitter, savoury aftertaste. A favourite among chefs, who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes.\n\nVERDICT: After tasting so many sweet honeys, this one came as a total shock. A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner. Perfect if you want something completely different. 3/5.\n\nChestnut Honey is a dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe. There's lots of families.\n\n\"It's not just about massive headlining acts. And it's not going to be a swamp of corporate beer-swilling drunkards.\n\n\"There's rain and there's mud but it's new and it doesn't smell bad yet. It's like, 'oh, this mud smells like grass! It's spring!'\"\n\nThe music continues on Saturday with Jake Bugg, Pixies, Clean Bandit and Manic Street Preachers on the bill.\n\nAmong those watching the action will be Hollywood star Bradley Cooper, who told the BBC: \"I'm excited to see Metallica and I want to see Jack White and Lana Del Rey.\"\n\nAsked if he was put off by the weather, the Hangover star replied: \"I love it. I do! But I'm a dumb American - you expect it.\"\n\nGlastonbury 2014",

        "input": "Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes.\n\nThe popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell.\n\nBut for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters.\n\nThe child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",
        "output": "Researchers are studying synaesthesia, a neurological condition where two or more sense become connected and experienced together. Studies indicate that a person can be born with it, learn it through repeated cultural exposure, or even develop it after a stroke or after taking hallucinogenic drugs. "

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you?

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",
        "output": "The Liberal Democrats are optimistic about winning across the country, but polls and ratings have narrow margins and conflicting results. Without a clear poll leader, Liberal Democrats are campaigning hard, stating they are the best way to keep balance, not swinging too far right or left. "

A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma.

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019.\n\nMARCH 2014.\n\nEngland suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18.\n\nAPRIL 2014.\n\nDownton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach.\n\nMAY 2014.\n\nDownton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared \u2018disinterested\u2019 and \u2018distracted\u2019 during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney.\n\nJUNE 2014.\n\nEngland lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka.

In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history.\n\nDECEMBER 2014.\n\nCook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats.\n\nFEBRUARY-MARCH 2015.\n\nEngland endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory.\n\nAPRIL 2015.\n\nDownton departs as ECB managing director.

This light and delicate honey comes from Hampshire, and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour.\n\nVERDICT: You can\u2019t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid, because the pale honey that surrounds it isn\u2019t transparent.\n\nI\u2019ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself, but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again.\n\nIt crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey (not quite runny but not totally set) unleashes a real taste of the countryside. The jar, with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label, gives this a real sense of occasion. 4/5.\n\nHeather Honeycomb Starflower Honey\u00a0crumbles delightfully in the mouth, while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside.\n\nChestnut Honey.\n\n\u00a36.95 for 500g, souschef.co.uk.\n\nPROMISE: A dark, runny honey with a rich, nutty taste and smoky aromas.

A dark brown, treacle-tasting honey, it has a wonderful, unmistakable chestnut aroma. My children didn\u2019t like it at all, but I teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner.

Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.'\n\n'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.'\n\n'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?'\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.\n\n'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media.\n\n'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: \"The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.\"'\n\nThe full op-ed can be read at USA Today.\n\n'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote.

He has been hosting the program since 2009.\n\n'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.'\n\nEven though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the\u00a0power of prayer or techniques abroad.\n\nDefense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism.\n\nVehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information.\n\nHe said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements.\n\n'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.'\n\nAnd talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported.\n\n'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted \u2013 sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics.\n\n'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.'\n\nFour who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health.\n\nDefiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food.\n\nThe organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.\n\nDuring his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods.\n\n'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.'\n\nDr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country.\n\n'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.'\n\nColumbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'",

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said.\n\n'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said.\n\nThe school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms.\n\nThe usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor.\n\n'I left my house which was the only thing I had.

But that was before it too was caught up in the widespread civil unrest which erupted in 2011.\n\nIn late December 2012, Yarmouk - just four miles from central Damascus - became a battlefield between pro- and anti-government forces before a merciless siege began.\n\nThe camp has been encircled for more than a year, but is now reported to be almost completely under the control of ISIS and Al Qaeda's local affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nResidents who fled the advancing jihadists last week have been put up in regime-held areas nearby.\n\nAccording to Britain-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, nearly 200 people had died in Yarmouk from malnutrition and lack of medicines before last Wednesday's assault.\n\nCarnage:\u00a0Before the Islamic State assault, there were around 18,000 people in Yarmouk in a southern neighbourhood of the Syrian capital Damascus.\n\nKeeping the faith: A Palestinian man who fled the Yarmouk  refugee camp prays inside a school in Damascus.\n\nSpeaking of the moment he stumbled on the ISIS militants, 16-year-old Amjad said:\u00a0'In Palestine Street, I saw two members of Daesh playing with a severed head as if it was a football.\n\nWearing a baseball cap sideways, rapper-style, the youth has a swollen eye and chin.\n\n'Daesh came to my home looking for my brother who's in the Palestinian Popular Committees.

Before that we didn't fear death, because if there was fighting, the rebels made sure the civilians got to shelters,' said Abir, a 47-year-old woman who was born and raised in Yarmouk.\n\nThere are no suitcases to be seen in the classrooms -- the families had to leave so quickly there was no time to pack anything.\n\n'I left without bringing any belongings.

        "input": "Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes.\n\nThe popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell.\n\nBut for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters.\n\nThe child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",
        "output": "Researchers are studying synaesthesia, a neurological condition where two or more sense become connected and experienced together.

        "input": "Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a 'disease that can and should be cured'\n\nWith his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",
        "output": "Aubrey de Gray believes that humans can live to be thousands of years old in the near future.  He has secured funding from tech billionaires to conduct research. His basic premise is humans will be able to change out their organs and clean up their cells in order to increase their longevity. "

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",
        "output": "During the Sky Bet Championship, Wigan and Millwall teams engaged in a heated clash.

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "Indiana declared a public health emergency due to high numbers of new HIV infections in rural counties. The spread is believed to be from sharing needles by those abusing a prescription opioid medication. The CDC has established a clinic and provided assistance and education in hopes of stopping the spread. "

An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.",

A reading below 50 indicates falling output.\n\nIt is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013.\n\nFirms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum.\n\nA slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production.\n\nThe index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.\n\nRob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.\n\n\"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\"\n\nLast week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector.\n\nDavid Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality.\n\n\"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.\n\n\"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\"\n\nThe Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings.

He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.'\n\nA stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event.\n\nMendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre.\n\nMendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield.\n\nAnticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo.\n\n'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

I'm so, so happy with my displays,\" Peaty said.\n\nHe was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third.\n\nIt was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short.\n\nThe Briton suggested \"equilibrium\" was key to his successes.\n\n\"I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best,\" he added. \"Lifestyle, family and friendships.

It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast.\n\nFormer British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was \"immense\".\n\n\"There not enough words to describe how good he is,\" he said.\n\n\"Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time.

Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds.\n\nYou couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid.

United States swimmer Caleb Dressel won the other semi-final in 47.66.\n\nTeam-mate Max Litchfield reached the 200 individual medley (IM) final after finishing second in his semi-final in a time of 1:56.70. He is third fastest overall, with Japan's Kosuke Hagino, who won 400m IM gold in Rio, leading the pack after recording 1:56.04.\n\n\"We're always in the mix - it'll be a tough race,\" Litchfield told BBC Sport. \"It'll be nice to get a little bit of revenge after finishing fourth in the 400m IM at Rio 2016.\"\n\nSouth Africa's Chad le Clos stormed to victory in the 200m butterfly final in one minute 53.33 seconds. Home favourite Laszlo Cseh closed the gap to the London 2012 champion in the final few metres, but had to settle for silver.\n\nLe Clos was in tears during the medal ceremony.

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

'Tommy's is blue,' she added.\n\nJail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.\n\nSchaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered.\n\nThe couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit.\n\nThey tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel.\n\nMack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.\n\nMack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer\u2019s attack with the metal bowl.\n\nShe said they thought about\u00a0either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one.\n\nWhen the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her.\n\nShortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly.\n\nMack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years.\n\nThe baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice.\n\nThe child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother.\n\nMack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old.\n\nShe revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.",

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\"\n\nShe has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career.\n\nHere are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years.\n\nSuper Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible.\n\nNot Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety.\n\nIt was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\n\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeat that, Gaga.\n\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\n\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\n\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\n\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\n\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\n\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\n\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\n\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\n\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\n\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\n\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\n\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\n\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\n\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\n\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\n\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\n\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\n\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\n\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\n\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\n\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\n\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",

        "input": "Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.\n\nBut what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe.\n\n\"Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?\" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.\n\nWhen no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel.\n\n\"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge.\n\n\"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",
        "output": "Mead is making a comeback in the US. Brewers are revamping old recipes in order to make the drink less sweet. Mead brewers are also battling an image problem where mead is classified as a sweet wine or something only Vikings drink.  "

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

        "input": "The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised.\n\nThey call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check.\n\nThere is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light.\n\nPeople in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nResidents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. \u00a0Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial.\n\nThe officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",
        "output": "Potential investors are deciding the fate of BHS, a failing department store with 164 locations. There are several ultra-rich businessmen who have made bids, although the details vary and no deal has been made. If no sales agreement is made, the company has arrangements for their assets to be liquidated. "

The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",

A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.\n\nLee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.\n\n\"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"",

Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating.

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",

'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",

His basic premise is humans will be able to change out their organs and clean up their cells in order to increase their longevity. "

He left a lesser figure.\n\nThe referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.\n\nSurely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?\n\nNo.\n\nInstead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.\n\n\"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.\n\n\"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\"\n\nWhen he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.\n\nIn Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.\n\nBurns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.\n\nBuchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.\n\n\"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns.\n\n\"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.\n\n\"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.\n\n\"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?\"\n\nHearn said suitors could \"make all the offers they want, we'll listen\".\n\n\"If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.\"\n\nAt that point Burns quipped: \"I'd be one of them.\"\n\nThe lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.",
        "output": "Scottish Ricky Burns entered Glasgow's Hydra fights as the underdog, but emerged victorious after 8 rounds, earning the title of WBA World Super-Lightweight Champion. Despite his win, he remains notably humble, and looks forward to future fight opportunities. "

        "input": "A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim.\n\nAt the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nHydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy. This method would allow eco-friendly energy sources like wind to be stored and used as a chemical energy source. "

        "input": "Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe.\n\nFellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal.\n\nNow Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him.\n\n'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.'\n\nFellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby.\n\nUnited are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.\n\n'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney.\n\n'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in.\n\n'We have been working really hard.\n\n'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.'\n\n'We are confident going to Chelsea.\n\n'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea.\n\nLouis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth.\n\n'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can.\n\n'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue.\n\n'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",
        "output": "Wayne Rooney commends teammate and fellow striker Marouane Fellaini for his remarkable improvement. Manchester United now sits in third place thanks in part to Fellaini's increased performance. Rooney believes that the manager is using Fellaini in the right way and the team is being rewarded for it.   "

If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\"\n\nIt continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\"\n\nSaid another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\"\n\nOne person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\"\n\nStill others took the opportunity to crack jokes.\n\n\"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\"\n\nPlastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.\n\nMore than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014.\n\nThe industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene.\n\nThis no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC\u2019s on-site studio.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t like semi finals at Wembley\u2019, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it. Well, some twenty four hour or so later, Wembley was certainly delighted to host them.\n\nArsenal players celebrate during the victory over Reading which saw the Gunners reach the FA Cup final.\n\nFabian Delph (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Liverpool at Wembley.\n\nWembley Stadium was a great setting for this weekend's two FA Cup semi-final clashes.\n\nPrior to that first clash on Saturday between Arsenal and Reading, there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the Emirates Stadium. This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as \u2018difficult to watch\u2019.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion.\n\nAlongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn\u2019t treat their premature trip to north west London as \u2018a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal.\n\nWell, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement.\n\nReading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn\u2019t it Wrighty?\u2019, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. \u2018Don\u2019t start again, Gary!\u2019, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros.\n\nAnd then there was Reading\u2019s Adam Federici. I was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups, and while doing so chose to cut away from manager Steve Clarke beginning to console his crestfallen keeper. A few minutes later, they did decide to show it, though. I almost wished they hadn\u2019t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella\u2019s suffering. Nevertheless it was compelling stuff, and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special.\n\nReading goalkeeper Adam Federici (centre) is consoled by Royals boss Steve Clarke after the final whistle.\n\nCome Sunday, and the man who would be drawing the camera\u2019s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go. As soon as Steven Gerrard was announced in the starting line up, there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of BT Sport\u2019s story.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t  all about the outgoing captain. They opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - Villa\u2019s Tom and Liverpool\u2019s John-Paul (naturally!) - recreated each team\u2019s cup runs in their back gardens. We then saw the two young stars walking up Wembley way together, helping to remind us about the supporter\u2019s part in the occasion.\n\nThis was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host Jake Humphrey and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment. It also enabled us to hear the Villa fans give Robbie Savage a, shall we say, robust welcome as he approached their end!\n\nFormer Birmingham City midfielder Robbie Savage (right) received a robust welcome from the Villa faithful.\n\nFrom the moment we first saw Stevie G trotting out onto the pitch to warm up, right up until the moment  commentator Ian Darke exclaimed \u2018off the line, Gerrard\u2019s header\u2019, the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention. Come the final whistle, the Liverpool captain was clearly reluctant to be.\n\nIt was something BT handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with Man of the Match Fabian Delph as the main shot showed Gerrard sullenly leaving the Wembley turf for possibly the last time.\n\nYet another moment that made Wembley the ideal setting for an FA Cup semi-final TV audience to enjoy even more magic from this season\u2019s tournament? I\u2019ll leave that thought with you.\n\nMuch of the attention was on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's semi-final clash on BT Sport.",

It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.'\n\nWhen asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened.\n\n'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.\n\n'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.'\n\nFormer Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club.\n\nItalian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London.\n\nAccording to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday.\n\nBut Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road.\n\n'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek.\n\n'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.'\n\nStriker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw.\n\n'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said.\n\n'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.'\n\nThe withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds.\n\nMirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton.\n\nNeil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game.\n\nRedfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.\n\nHe saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime.\n\nClub president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time.\n\nCherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club.\n\n'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said.\n\n'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened.\n\n'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",

        "input": "Some doctors in England are being offered thousands of pounds to cut the number of patients being sent to hospital, an investigation has found.\n\nGP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found.\n\nAppointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients.\n\nThe British Medical Association said such incentives were \"misguided\".\n\nAt least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation.\n\nIn one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than \u00c2\u00a311,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15.\n\nIt said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care\".\n\n\"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG.\n\nAnother CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest\".\n\nPulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern.\n\nThe magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition.\n\nDr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a \"financial contaminant\" to patient-doctor trust.\n\nHe said: \"It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals.\n\n\"We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms.\"\n\nDr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15.\n\nHe said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital.\n\n\"It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,\" he explained.\n\n\"The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.\"\n\nAnalysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs\n\nThe NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out \u00c2\u00a322bn of efficiency savings by 2020.\n\nNHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.\n\nClinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are groups of GPs that work together to plan and design local health services.\n\nThere are more than 200 CCGs across England and, according to Pulse, at least nine are offering payments for keeping within targets for outpatient referrals and follow ups. It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.\n\nSome have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.\n\nIn November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.\n\nNHS England said: \"We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.\"\n\nDr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as \"very worrying\".\n\n\"This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,\" she said.\n\nNHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.\n\n\"The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,\" said a spokesperson.",
        "output": "To cut costs, doctors in England are being paid by the NHS to limit the number of patients admitted to the hospital. Cost-cutting measures include scans for cancer patients. Many physicians in the UK find the practice appalling, preferring a system that prioritizes people over profits. "

He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits.\n\nHowever Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus.\n\nShe said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"'\n\nLizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nShe continued: 'It was terrible.

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

He is a handful for defenders to mark.\n\nMarouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United.\n\n'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.\n\n'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.'\n\nFellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.\n\nWayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment.\n\nFellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool.\n\nNow the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier.\n\n'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney.\n\n'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him.\n\n'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch.\n\n'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were.\n\n'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him.

        "input": "Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes.\n\nThe popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell.\n\nBut for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters.\n\nThe child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground.\n\nAt least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nIt is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time.\n\nA large amount of research, according to\u00a0Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors.\n\nThis graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter.\n\nThe latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters.\n\nThey then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990.\n\nThe results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set.\n\nAmong those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent.\n\nThe colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row)\n\nRed bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent.\n\nSynaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together.\n\nFor instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes.\n\nSome people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.\n\nThere have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition.\n\nReports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high-levels of creativity and intelligence.\n\nBut among those born five years or more before it was manufactured, none of the colour-letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set.\n\n'Analysis of the letter-colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus,' explained the paper.\n\n'This indicates learning of letter-colour pairings from external [sources] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic, and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery.'\n\nThe authors did point out, however, that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.\n\nThey also said their findings don't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia.\n\nInstead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\n\nThe authors did point out that there may have been other cues \u2013 such as cultural influences, or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role.",
        "output": "Researchers are studying synaesthesia, a neurological condition where two or more sense become connected and experienced together.

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "Indiana declared a public health emergency due to high numbers of new HIV infections in rural counties. The spread is believed to be from sharing needles by those abusing a prescription opioid medication. The CDC has established a clinic and provided assistance and education in hopes of stopping the spread. "

And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\"\n\nSpeaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.\n\n\"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'\n\n\"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\"\n\nHarper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.\n\nThe story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.\n\nThe Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.\n\nHe had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.\n\nHe says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\n\n\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\n\n\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\n\n\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"\n\nBut these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.\n\nThe old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.\n\nCapote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\n\n\"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

They work dark sunglasses, kept quiet and went unrecognized. It took security camera footage to prove they were ever there.\n\nOnce in Iowa, Clinton's campaign vetted and planted fans of the Democrat in a coffee shop it knew she would make an unannounced stop at and hold what appeared at the time to be an impromptu round table discussion.\n\nThe back-to-back incidents were widely panned as further proof that Clinton is out-of-touch.\n\nClinton skipped the long ride home and returned via commercial aircraft. She sat in the coach section, though, and was photographed dragging around her own luggage.\n\nWEEKEND OUTING: Hillary wasn't the only one spending time with her husband. Huma Abedin, her closest aide, was with her husband Anthony Weiner, notorious for sabotaging his own political career by sending explicit pictures. The couple ignored the chance to go to Chipotle, two doors down from this New York taco restaurant.\n\nBRUSH-UP: Meanwhile, the two rest of the enoturage for the vans she's been riding around in got some TLC at a local car wash.\n\nCAR WASH: The vehicles were also washed by hand.\u00a0Clinton skipped the long ride home last week from Iowa and returned via commercial aircraft. She'll make the short drive from New York to New Hampshire in her motorcade today, however.\n\nCLOSELY-GUARDED: The Hillary motorcade includes these - now sparkling - Chevy Suburbans.",

The majority of rooms on the Strip are reserved for proven high-rollers with track records of seven-figure gambling. Sibella says: 'We are taking care of major clients from all over the world.'\n\nMany late-comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens.\n\nSibella expects 50,000 people to set foot in the MGM each day for Friday's weigh-in and Saturday's main event itself, in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites.\n\nMerchandise for the fight on sale at the MGM Grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event.\n\nA hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten American Mayweather.\n\nThe hotel is putting the finishing touches on it's preparations for the biggest event in Las Vegas history.\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nWho do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao?\n\nNow share your opinion.\n\nA hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the Grand Garden Arena.\n\nAll this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the MGM Grand and the group's 13 other hotel-casinos on the Strip.\n\nIn its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca, Vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation, restaurants, bars and shows than it does from betting.\n\nSibella says: 'At an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue.'\n\nNevertheless, the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on New Year's Eve and equalled for Mike Tyson's biggest fights.\n\nProjections for the economic impact on the Vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial $400m (\u00a3265m) to well over a billion dollars.\n\nThis is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years.\n\nThe MGM has an army of 9,000 employees, almost two to every three hotel guests. Many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious.\n\nMayweather's fight against Pacquiao will take place at the MGM Grand's 16,000-capacity Garden Arena.\n\nFewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately.\n\nAs well as being a hotel, the MGM Grand is a world-famous resort with casinos and entertainment.\n\nIt is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in Las Vegas history but ask Sibella for his greatest concern and he says: 'The safety of all these people.'\n\nFights this big bring special risks. There will be a melting pot of thousands of Mayweather's fellow American rappers and almost as many Filipino immigrants supporting Pacquiao.\n\nBut it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts.\n\nA number of fight nights at the Grand Garden have ended in pushing, shoving and near-crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave.\n\nFortunately there have been no fatalities but after Mayweather's most recent fight here, against Marcos Maidana, a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment.\n\nAfter 'the last stampede,' as Sibella describes it, he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control.\n\nA Grand King Room, which on Monday was being sold on the website for over $1,800 for the night of the fight.\n\nThe MGM resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it's entertainment experience.\n\nGambling is a huge source of revenue for most Las Vegas hotels, including the MGM Grand.\n\nThe two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside, lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous.\n\nResorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but Sibella is putting safety first.\n\nAlthough the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance, movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket-holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations.\n\n'The problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people-watchers blocking their movement,' says Sibella. 'We are now working on opening up more exit routes.'\n\nFurthermore, this Saturday, the rubber-neckers will be kept at a distance. They will be further discouraged by the celebrities \u2013 sports stars and Hollywood royalty among them - using a private, guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng.\n\nMetal detectors have been obligatory since Tyson's infamous ear-biting fight against Evander Holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor, with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon.\n\nMayweather's last 10 fights have all taken place at the MGM Grand, including two against Marcos Maidana.\n\nThe unbeaten American beat Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand in December 2007.\n\nHatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in May 2009.\n\nSibella says: 'Like Floyd and Manny, we need a perfect game plan.'\n\nMore than 50,000 of the out-of-towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot-spot to watch closed-circuit TV transmission on giant screens located in all the MGM properties.\n\nEven that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $150 (\u00a399) a ticket. For the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh-in \u2013 at the arena on Friday \u2013 to facilitate crowd control for that event. Proceeds \u2013 at $10 a head \u2013 will go to charities nominated by Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\nCome Saturday, MGM corporate security, the Las Vegas police and Nevada State Troopers will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the Strip.\n\nMayweather beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in 2007 in a fight that set pay-per-view records.\n\nThose travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop-off and pick-up points.\n\nTyson's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but Sibella expects Mayweather and Pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion.\n\nHe says: 'The styles of Floyd and Manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype.\n\nIf it's the great fight I expect, it will help create the happy night we all want.'\n\nJust for the record, most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena. No beer or any other alcohol allowed.",

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the opioid crisis in rural Scott, Indiana, has grown. The culprit, a prescription opioid called Opana, is being used interveineously by residents. Both the lack of clean needles and the composition of the drug itself has contributed to a startling string of new HIV infections."

        "input": "Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset.\n\n\"My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,\" Klitschko told CNN.\n\n\"I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,\" he added.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting.\"\n\nKlitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century.\n\nVitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year.\n\nTensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia.\n\nThe move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead.\n\nThe following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\n\"People are dying in Ukraine every single day,\" Klitschko said. \"I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen.\"\n\nBut with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship.\n\n\"I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.\n\n\"If somebody wants to try to put (us) back to the Soviet times and be part of the former Soviet Union, we disagree with that. We want to be in freedom.\n\n\"We have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship.\"\n\nKlitschko, whose comments were made as part of a wide-ranging interview for CNN's Human to Hero series, is routinely kept abreast of developments in Ukraine by brother Vitali but also returns home whenever he can.\n\n\"As much time as I can spend, I am there in the Ukraine. It's not like I am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what's going on. It's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... It obviously affects my life, it affects the life of my family.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old and his fianc\u00e9e Hayden Panettiere celebrated happier times last December when the American actress gave birth to a baby daughter, Kaya.\n\n\"I need to get used to it that I'm a father, which is really exciting. I hope I'm going to have a big family with multiple kids,\" he said.\n\nKlitschko isn't sure when he'll finally hang up his gloves. \"I don't know how long I can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue.\"\n\nBut after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the Ukrainian is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against Jennings -- Klitschko is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country's corner in the opposite way outside the ring.\n\n\"I just really want that we'll have less violence in the world ... I hope in peace we can do anything, but if we have war then it's definitely going to leave us dull and numb.\"\n\nWatch Wladimir Klitschko's Human to Hero interview on CNN's World Sport program on Wednesday April 8 at 1130, 1245, 1445, 2130, 2245 and 2345 and Thursday April 9 at 0445 (All times GMT) and here online.",

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn).\n\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.\n\nJohn Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\".\n\nThe petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.\n\nThe European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\n\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\n\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",

He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain.\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate.\n\nUltimately it was England\u2019s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton.\n\n\u2018The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,\u2019 said Harrison in an ECB statement. \u2018The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.\u2019\n\nMichael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton.\n\nVaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender.\n\nThat new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector.\n\nThat makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today\u2019s board meeting at Lord\u2019s.\n\nYet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves.\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t impact on Peter Moores\u2019 position at all,\u2019 Harrison said later on Sky. \u2018This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.\u2019\n\nDownton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing.\n\nEngland selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session.\n\nMoores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference.\n\nOCTOBER 2013.\n\nDownton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014.\n\nAfter the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked.

Read on.\n\nProfile: Boris Johnson\n\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\n\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\n\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\n\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\n\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\n\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\n\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\n\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\n\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\n\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\n\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\n\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\n\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\n\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\n\nNo, that's Julian Assange.",
        "output": "Boris Johnson announces his support for Brexit causing a stir in English politics. The mayor of London and a member of Parliament has made his career from unorthodox actions. Actions such as ziplining during the London Olympics. Despite his antics, Johnson remains a popular figure in the Conservative party.  "

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nAnother poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour.\n\nHowever, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders.\n\nLabour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one).\n\nNorth of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.",

        "input": "(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana.\n\nThe outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March.\n\nIndiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nSo far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment.\n\nIt's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles.\n\nMermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections.\n\nThe state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\"\n\nMany family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade.\n\nAnother reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said.\n\n\"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",
        "output": "Indiana declared a public health emergency due to high numbers of new HIV infections in rural counties. The spread is believed to be from sharing needles by those abusing a prescription opioid medication. The CDC has established a clinic and provided assistance and education in hopes of stopping the spread. "

It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal.\n\n'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch.\n\nThe Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley.\n\n'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run.\n\n'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.'\n\nClarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith.\n\nOne bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins.\n\nIt has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.\n\n'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games.\n\n'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve.\n\n'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.'\n\nReading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth.\n\nSteve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins.\n\nClarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford.\n\n'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said.\n\n'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice.\n\nReading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run.\n\n'I think that is reflected in the game (against Bournemouth), when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very, very much.\n\n'Bournemouth, because they're on a winning run, know how to get over the line and win at the moment.\n\n'We're struggling in the league a little bit to find a way to win games, whereas in the cup we've been good.\n\n'We've known how to win the cup games so hopefully that continues on Saturday.'",

'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued.\n\n'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good.

But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added.\n\n'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.\n\n'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.'\n\nMendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAnd Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes.\n\n'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out.\n\n'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.'\n\nLamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session.\n\nMeanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.\n\nWatch UFC Fight Night: Mendes vs. Lamas live on BT Sport 1 on Saturday, April 4.

We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\"\n\nThe thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air.\n\nMusic resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n\nOther performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour.\n\nArcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.\n\nBravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.\n\nThey  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs.\n\nAs well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.\n\nFrontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance.\n\nThe set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).\n\nThe group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.\n\nPlus, they have really catchy choruses.\n\nThe band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.\n\nAs the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage.\n\n\"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\"\n\nThe feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday.\n\n\"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a nice vibe.

Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander.\n\nIt's fair to say he is obsessed with mead.\n\n\"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes.\n\nAfter being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.\n\nHis business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.\n\nIt's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.\n\nMr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.\n\nVicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade.\n\n\"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says.\n\n\"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\"\n\nEven visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.\n\nTour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\".\n\nJust this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.\n\nBut there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments.\n\n\"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander.\n\n\"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\"\n\nThe mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed.\n\n\"People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet,\" says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.\n\nYet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.\n\nTechnically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.\n\nThis means that mead has to be labelled as \"honey wine\", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet.\n\n\"How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?\" says Ms Rowe.\n\nIronically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.\n\nThe craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire.\n\n\"I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it,\" says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\"Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'\" he says.\n\nAfter he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was \"kind of an untouched category\", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.\n\nSo when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nNow, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.\n\nBut for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning.\n\n\"If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%,\" says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander.\n\n\"So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage.\n\n\"You've got a canvas with very few limits.\"",

Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating.

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",
        "output": "During the Sky Bet Championship, Wigan and Millwall teams engaged in a heated clash.

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.\n\nLast week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.\n\nHis team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.\n\nBut if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.\n\nThe remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.\n\nSome of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.\n\nBut then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31.\n\nSo what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?\n\nIn the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.\n\nBut that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.\n\nAnd as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.\n\nHe describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\".\n\nHis record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.\n\nHe then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.\n\nHe currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.\n\nEarlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.\n\nIts other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.\n\nUntil Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.\n\nBut it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.\n\nLike Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBut in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.\n\nMr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.\n\nAs a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.\n\nMr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.\n\nNames that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.\n\nOne factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.\n\nIf no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.\n\nThe 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.",

And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing.\n\nBrilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBeat that, Gaga.\n\nBaby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera.\n\nIn his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM!\n\n\"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\"\n\nIt led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\n\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\n\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\n\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\n\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\n\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\n\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\n\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\n\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\n\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\n\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\n\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\n\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\n\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\n\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\n\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\n\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\n\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\n\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\n\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

        "input": "A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim.\n\nAt the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy.\n\nBut the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\nHydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily.\n\nResearchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention.\n\nIt uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel.\n\nLead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces.\n\nWater splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively.\n\nThe energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two.\n\nThe new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process.\n\nIt can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner.\n\nThe process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost.\n\nWith this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency.\n\n\u2018Oxygen is the most difficult bit,\u2019 Dr Hintermair explained.\n\nTheir catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn\u2019t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is \u2018almost non-existent\u2019.\n\nThe major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.\n\n\u2018We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can\u2019t store it very well,\u2019 Dr Hintermair continued.\n\n\u2018We can put it in a battery but you can\u2019t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet.\n\n\u2018So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.\u2019\n\nThis, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical.\n\nOn this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen.\n\nThe team are in discussions with a number of energy companies about utilising this technology on a large scale and hope the breakthrough marks the start of contributing to providing the world with more sustainable fuels.\n\n\u2018In theory it could be used on all systems, but it depends on cost and scale,\u2019 said Dr Hintermair.\n\nAs regulations tighten on the use of fossil fuels and their emissions, there is a growing focus on the need for cost effective and efficient ways of creating energy carriers from renewable sources.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, while the price of photovoltaic technology has dramatically decreased in recent years as demand has risen, solar energy is problematic as it is intermittent, meaning electricity is only created when it is light.\n\nOne use of the newly developed catalyst could be to store the energy produced by solar power by using the electricity to produce hydrogen which can then be used on demand, regardless of the time of day.\n\nSolar power is thought to be able to provide up to four per cent of the UK's electricity by the end of the decade (Wymeswold Solar Farm in Leicestershire, UK shown), but storing it is difficult. This new technology could store energy as hydrogen, which can then be used on demand.\n\nDr Hintermair is a Whorrod research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies at the University of Bath.\n\n'Hydrogen is a fantastically versatile and environmentally friendly fuel, however, hydrogen-powered applications are only as \"green\" as the hydrogen on which they run,' he said.\n\n'Currently, over 90 per cent is derived from fossil fuels. If we want to bring about a clean hydrogen economy we must first generate clean hydrogen.\n\n'This new molecular catalyst will hopefully play a large role in helping create hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\n'We are also interested in applying this technology to other forms of renewable energy such as tidal, wind and wave power.'\n\nProfessor Matthew Davidson, head of the department of chemistry, added: 'Splitting water into its constituent parts is deceptively simple chemistry, but doing it in a sustainable way is one of the holy grails of chemistry because it is the key step in the goal of artificial photosynthesis.\n\n'[Dr Hintermair's] results are extremely exciting because of their potential for practical application.'",
        "output": "The University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new way to create hydrogen from water that leaves very little waste, which they claim has huge potential to provide green energy. This method would allow eco-friendly energy sources like wind to be stored and used as a chemical energy source. "

What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn\u2019t a misprint.\n\nThere was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O\u2019Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall\u2019s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction.\n\nThe game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm.\n\nAnd a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson.\n\nMillwall\u2019s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night.\n\nThe plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points.\n\nHarris had described this match as a \u2018Cup Final\u2019 and his players responded. Snapping into every challenge, first to every ball, they wanted it more than Caldwell\u2019s men.\n\nWigan's former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant (left) takes on Dan Harding of Millwall.\n\nMillwall's Aiden O'Brien (left) competes with Emmerson Boyce of Wigan during the relegation six-pointer.\n\nThe Lions manager proudly declared afterwards: \u2018That was a Millwall performance, that\u2019s what this club is all about. If the players haven\u2019t learned anything from me before tonight, they certainly have now.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily condone challenges and melees but if you need a spark at The Den, then you have to take care of your own.\u2019\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t resist a joke at the expense of Abdou\u2019s scoring record after his first goal in two years.\n\n\u2018Jimmy Abdou is a great fellow, a great servant to Millwall FC,\u2019 he said. \u2018If anyone deserved that goal for his performances since I took over. He has the ability to do that and I\u2019ve been telling him for seven years he can do that.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got the ability in the legs, I think his last goal was in training about three and a half years ago!\u2019\n\nWith Wigan seven points from safety, Millwall\u2019s approach left manager Gary Caldwell irritated. He said: \u2018There was one team out there trying to play football and another trying to rough us up.\n\n\u2018The game got out of hand second-half, we needed a strong ref in a stadium like this.\u2019\n\nWigan\u2019s James McClean rattled the outside of the post with a cross-cum-shot that almost caught goalkeeper David Forde out after five minutes, while at the other end, Scott Carson had to race off his line to thwart Aiden O\u2019Brien when he broke clear.\n\nBut overall the first-half was a poor spectacle, enlivened only by the handbags that engaged the crowd.\n\nWigan's James Perch (right) goes up for a header with Millwall midfielder Shaun Williams.\n\nWigan manager Gary Caldwell looks on nervously as his hopes of survival are dented.\n\nWithin the first five minutes of the second-half, Millwall created more than their sum total in the first. Former England stopper Carson had to be at his athletic best to turn away an O\u2019Brien shot that seemed destined for the top corner.\n\nAnd when thew red mist descended on Waghorn, there was only one winner. It coincided with Millwall\u2019s best spell in the game and they capitalised when Abdou produced his potentially season-defining header.\n\nAfter Gueye made sure at the end, chants of \u2018Super Neil Harris\u2019 echoed around the ground. Is another heroic act from this club legend on the cards?",

He has carried us through.'\n\nAn appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News.\n\nOriginal prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since.\n\nOn a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well.\n\nWhen he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning.\n\nA week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning.\n\nBut during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.\n\nThe mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence.\n\nLate last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again.\n\nOverturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right)\n\nNew details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death.\n\nThe defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested.\n\nThe pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial.\n\nDr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder.\n\n'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal.\n\nTeachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion.\n\nAndrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica.\n\nThe boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children.\n\nBut the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home.\n\n'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008.\n\nEastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.",

In 2009, a medical mission landed there.\n\nAs part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered.\n\nThe samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study.\n\nYanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests.\n\nThousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.\n\nThe Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade.\n\nThe Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected.\n\nOnly 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died.\n\nKeen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent.\n\nThe Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions.\n\nWithout obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s.\n\nYanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood.\n\n'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.'\n\nBack in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples.\n\nFrom this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies.\n\nThe researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles.\n\nBacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics.\n\nThis finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use.\n\nWhat happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments.\n\n'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home.\n\n'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.'\n\nMr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats.\n\nOpinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent.\n\nThe Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nMr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats.\n\nThe Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge.\n\nMr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country.\n\n'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.'\n\nHe added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media.\n\n'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.'\n\nMr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support.\n\nThe alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'.\n\nIn a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat.\n\n'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.'\n\nHe added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.'\n\nAsked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.'\n\nA new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.\n\nThe Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe.\n\nThe latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call.\n\nDavid Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft.

Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating.

As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people.\n\nThe CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources.\n\nScott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said.

Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms.\n\nThe other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection.\n\nHealth leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown.

But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"",

Dip instead; simply decant your spreads into containers and away you go.\n\nWorkers could save up to \u00a31,300 a year if they prepared their lunch at home instead of buying pre-packed sandwiches and snacks from shops, research by vouchercloud.com revealed.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of Britons who buy their lunches out spend an average of \u00a31,840 a year, based on 46 working weeks, the research reveals.\n\nIn comparison, those who prepare food at home spend just \u00a3552 over the same period - a saving of a whopping \u00a31,288.\n\nThe startling difference came to light following a poll of adults across the UK, which found that a fifth of Britons choose to purchase their work-time lunches as opposed to making them at home.\n\nPita bread is also another wonderful lunchtime option and can be stuffed with any number of fillings, from hard boiled eggs, smoked meat and charred vegetables.\n\nExperiment with flavour combinations; stay Mediterranean with aubergine with chickpeas and coriander or keep it British with thinly sliced roast chicken, crisp lettuce and sweet baby tomatoes.\n\nRemember, anything you can put into a sandwich can be stuffed into a pita.\n\nStill sound too complicated? Try turning toast into a tartine.\n\nSpread with butter or mayonnaise and top with thinly sliced vegetables (radish and chicory, dressed lightly in lemon juice and olive oil work really well against crisp, hot toast) or layer slices of ham, chopped up dates and a salty cheese to make something a bit more glamorous.\n\nThe site also has more complicated options for those who have time on their hands and want to experiment.\n\nSteamed pork buns, which are traditionally eaten as a breakfast food in China are self-contained dough parcels which \u00a0can be filled (bao) or unfilled (mantou).\n\nJenny Xu from Food52 writes: 'Your first option is to go with the basic, unfilled mantou dough, then customise it to your heart's content.'\n\nSteamed Chinese buns (bao) are usually stuffed with meats such as roast pork and stir-fried mushrooms.\n\nYou can stuff your bun with anything you like including pork, vegetables and even mushrooms, before you steam them.\n\nFreeze after steaming to keep them fresh and warm them in the office microwave.\n\nLooking for something even more exotic?\n\nAuthor of The Banh Mi Handbook Andrea Nguyen has a brilliant Vietnamese sandwich recipe which should satisfy the fussiest of lunchtime eaters.\n\nBanh mi rolls are the Vietnamese take on the baguette and typically contain Asian fillings such as pickled vegetables, chillies and coriander as well as roast meats.\n\nThe bread is usually scooped out so that it resembles a cradle which your fillings can be placed in.\n\nTo make sure your sandwich doesn't go soggy, pack your vegetables separately and assemble when you get to the office.\n\nBuns or banh mi not doing it for you? Stuff some dumplings instead.\n\n'The best part about dumplings is that you can use anything to make fillings. I tend to lean towards two of my favorites: pork and chives for my meat option, and chives, egg, and vermicelli for my vegetarian option -- but these are only two out of numerous recipes out there,' Betty Liu of Food52 writes.\n\nGreek salad cracker with cucumber, olive tapenade and feta (left).

Above, two men pray at the memorial.\n\n'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday.\n\nThe mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases.\n\nNationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said.\n\n'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.'\n\nBoth Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence.\n\nVideo captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away.\n\nOriginal statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident.\n\nA dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light.\n\nSlager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police.\n\nHis new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'\n\nSlager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting.\n\nThe officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted.\n\nA steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down.\n\nMany said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior.\n\nScott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge.\n\nPOLICE VERSION.\n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down.\u00a0He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.\n\nWHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS.\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.\n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him.\n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim.\n\nThe result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear.\n\nSlager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason.\n\nBut Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them.\n\n'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/.\n\n'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.'\n\nMario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!'\n\n'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said.\n\nMario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned.\n\n'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.'\n\nGivens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case.\n\n'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said.\n\nDarby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint.\n\n'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.'\n\nDarby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.'\n\nSuch boards are few and far between in South Carolina.\n\nNorth Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.",
        "output": "A fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man took place at a traffic stop in Charleston, South Carolina. Walter Scott was pulled over for a broken tail light and was shot eight times in the back as he ran away.

There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice.\n\nReading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run.\n\n'I think that is reflected in the game (against Bournemouth), when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very, very much.\n\n'Bournemouth, because they're on a winning run, know how to get over the line and win at the moment.\n\n'We're struggling in the league a little bit to find a way to win games, whereas in the cup we've been good.\n\n'We've known how to win the cup games so hopefully that continues on Saturday.'",

A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing.\n\nBut you would be wrong.\n\nFor de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age.\n\nIt sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nPayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth \u00a31.5 billion) donated \u00a32.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing.\n\nWhile many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing.\n\nGoogle's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.'\n\nOne source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.'\n\nDe Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him \u00a311 million when she died in 2011 \u2013 \u00a39 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\n'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, \"We were with you all along\".'\n\nDe Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car \u2013 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'.\n\nHis argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body parts at a cellular level \u2013 leading to virtual immortality.\n\nPeople will still die in accidents and from suicide, 'but there is no reason that someone living today shouldn't live to 500, 1,000 years. As the technologies improve, lifespans will increase', says de Grey.\n\nHe believes the first person who will live to be 1,000 has already been born, and cites research that has dramatically extended the lives of mice, worms and fruit flies as proof science is 'catching up' with his theories that therapies which will genetically alter, replace and repair the cells in our bodies will be the key to eternal life.\n\nHe accuses the majority of us of being in a 'pro-ageing trance', content to accept ageing and death as inevitable, while the reality is that technology will, within two decades, he says, have advanced far enough that we can replace and repair faulty genes, 'clear out the gunk around cells' and rejuvenate our bodies.\n\nIt sounds fanciful but as he talks, it is clear that de Grey is empowered by the support of the Silicon Valley billionaires. 'It is a good feeling to finally be getting validation,' he admits.\n\nMany academics have dismissed his theories as pie in the sky. It should be noted that much of what he says is theoretical and, critics point out, de Grey has never actually done any practical lab work.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide (pictured) have an unconventional marriage and he admits to having 'two younger girlfriends'\n\nNir Barsilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said: 'Based on the biology that we know today, somewhere between 100 and 120 there is a roof in play and I challenge if we can get beyond it.' The oldest human to date was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in August 1997 at the age of 122 years 164 days.\n\nDe Grey has been mockingly compared to a 'Messiah' figure because of his flowing facial hair, and heads turn in the airport bar as he bangs his glass on the table and loudly pronounces that '150,000 people die every day worldwide and of those people, two-thirds die of ageing one way or another. That's 30 World Trade Centers every day. If I bring forward the cure for ageing by one day I've saved 100,000 lives'.\n\nDe Grey is notoriously eccentric. He refuses to carry a mobile phone ('anti-social, nasty things') and has never learned to drive due to a 'mental block'. 'Cars can kill people without it being the driver's fault,' he says. He gives interviews to 'spread the word' and has written several anti-ageing books.\n\nLast year he featured in a critically acclaimed independent movie, The Immortalists.\n\nDe Grey and his biologist wife Adelaide, 19 years his senior, have an unconventional marriage and he cheerfully admits to having 'two younger girlfriends', aged 45 and 24.\n\nIsn't juggling the needs of three women enough to age any man prematurely? He laughs: 'It keeps me busy.'\n\nCritics argue that if he is right and we all live longer, the world's resources will be stretched by overpopulation, but he hits back by saying: 'Society will adapt. People will have fewer children.'\n\nWhat about the cost of keeping so many people alive? 'People will continue to contribute to society because they will be healthier and more productive.\n\n'When people think about longevity they forget about the health and then they start to think this whole thing is morally questionable. It might be technologically fanciful but all we do is medical research. I work on stopping people from getting sicker as they get older. The by-product of that is longevity.\n\n'I have no idea if I will live to 100. I do know I'd like to have the chance to live to 100 when I am 99 rather than having that choice removed from me by declining health.'",
        "output": "Aubrey de Gray believes that humans can live to be thousands of years old in the near future.  He has secured funding from tech billionaires to conduct research. His basic premise is humans will be able to change out their organs and clean up their cells in order to increase their longevity. "

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter\u00a0Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past.\n\nAfter questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview.\n\nChannel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life.\n\nIn the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.\n\nThe American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal.\n\nSeemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.\n\nAt that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].'\n\nThe horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat.\n\nBut Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives.\n\nJustin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nAnd Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.\n\nHere are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:.\n\nThe model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given.\n\nNAOMI CAMPBELL.\n\nIn April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way.\n\nThe reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.\n\nNaomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.'\n\nThe interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.\n\nIn court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.\n\nRobert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart.\n\nROBERT PATTINSON.\n\nWhen Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest.\n\nRyan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart.\n\nRyan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.\n\nRob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off.\n\nAs Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension.\n\nJustin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER.\n\nIn 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning.\n\nThe host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake.\n\nJustin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.'\n\nHe then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.\n\nThe presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'\n\nThe radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back.\n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears.\n\nPETER ANDRE.\n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid.\n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married.\n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day.\n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact.\n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son.\n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.\n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life.\n\nRIHANNA.\n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise.\n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview.\n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR.\n\nS CLUB 7.\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR.\n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money.\n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money.\n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short.\n\nBEE GEES.\n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees.\n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.",
